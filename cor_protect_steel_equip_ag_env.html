	    <p><strong>Corrosion protection of steel equipment, operating in an aggressive environment (The example of technological equipment sugar refineries)</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Corrosion processes are often one of the most extensive problems associated with of rapid wear and tear of process equipment. In addition to this, today there are practically no perfect methods for providing equipment corrosion protection when operated in the most aggressive environment, which comes from the low degree of research of all occurring chemical processes. This became a prerequisite for organizing research focused on studying the interaction of metals used equipment with some aggressive media, which are the main corrosion inducing agents (by the example of sugar factory equipment during interaction with juices and acids).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As a result, it was found that the high level of wear of sugar factory equipment parts, subjected to aggressive conditions of corrosion processes, is the result of a whole complex of factors: temperature effect, abrasion and erosion, presence of aggressive additives, continuity of production cycle. Moreover, the most significant in terms of rate of corrosion processes is influence of aggressive environment - diffusion juice and standard syrup. Evaluation of efficiency of anticorrosive coatings application has shown that they allow not only to reduce corrosion rate, but also many times reduce costs of plant to replace equipment.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sugar is one of the most significant products at the present stage, which is widely used in many industries. Its most frequent use can be observed in the food industry; acting as a sweetener or gelling agent, it is an integral part of many food products [1, 2].</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In Russia sugar as a product of manufacturing scale has been produced since the 18th century, and the technology of its preparation has been known for many centuries. Today, either sugar cane or sugar beet serves as the prevailing raw material source for sugar production. It is important to emphasize that in the conditions of the domestic sugar industry, including the climatic characteristics of most Russian regions, it is beet sugar production that is the most common.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Despite the high development of production processes in domestic sugar factories, as well as the economic importance of the sugar industry as a whole, the current state of the industry emphasizes its somewhat lagging behind in terms of competitiveness of domestic production compared to foreign importers [3]. All this requires looking for ways to reduce costs, production losses, improve the quality of technological processes, as well as the implementation of innovative resource-saving technologies.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The results of the assessment of the production efficiency of the domestic sugar industry in terms of its production and technological complex show a relatively high level of production losses, which becomes the main source of reducing the overall level of profitability of activities. At the same time, the key problem in this case is the high level of wear and tear of equipment parts that are subject to aggressive conditions of corrosion processes [4].</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The main reasons for the high degree of aggressiveness of the working environment of the equipment of domestic sugar refineries consist of a variety of factors, reflected in Fig. 1.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="imgmob"><p><img style="text-align: center; width:98%"alt=" " src="http://www.akz23.ru/en/images/Factors_aggressiveness.png" style="height:500px; width:475px" title="Fig. 1. Factors of aggressiveness" /></p></div>
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At the same time, corrosion of metal surfaces, in addition to the high level of economic losses, leads to multiple destructions of sugar plant communications, which may become a source of threat not only for its functioning, but also for the employees of the enterprise.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Based on the above-mentioned reasons, a study was made, aimed at the feasibility of finding ways to reduce production losses, to increase the profitability of production processes, as well as to eliminate additional threats, which are a cumulative consequence of corrosion processes. The result of the work was a research of corrosive processes for steel surfaces of sugar refineries equipment with subsequent approbation of special protective coatings, which allow reducing the influence of corrosive environment factor on the occurrence of the relevant processes. 
                
                In addition, the economic assessment of the effectiveness of the applied method of protection of production equipment from corrosion was additionally carried out.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Materials and research methods</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Organization of research of corrosion processes was carried out at the sugar factory &quot;Crystal&quot; of JSC &quot;Agrocomplex named after N.I. Tkachev, located at the station Vyselki, Krasnodar Territory. The period of production maintenance was chosen, which is the most common for the relevant procedures (which comes from the impossibility of stopping the production complex during its operation). Initially, the author made a general inspection of metal surfaces of equipment parts that are exposed to active influence of aggressive environment. As a result, various types of corrosion damage were identified.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Corrosion rate was estimated in the course of electrochemical tests by a special technique [5]. In order to organize it, test samples were taken, made of low-carbon steel, with a total area of 50 sq. cm. After the procedures for degreasing, cleaning and polishing the surface, each sample was weighed. Subsequently, the samples were placed in special flasks with solutions of aggressive medium, the content of which was composition identical to that which occurs during the production of sugar. The tests lasted 24 hours at a temperature range of 55-60 &deg; C. At the end of the procedure the samples were dried. The completely dry samples were then cleaned of corrosion and were re-weighed. Fig. 2 shows the characteristic of the degree of influence of aggressive corrosive environments of sugar production on low carbon steel, used in the equipment.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Results and discussion</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The qualitative examination of the current state of units and the main mechanisms of the equipment of production and technological line of the sugar refinery revealed a large number of traces of corrosion action. Visual inspection of the internal parts of technological equipment showed that the metal surfaces were subjected to several types of corrosive influences simultaneously, as follows:</p>

            <p>1) chemical corrosion;</p>

            <p>2) gas corrosion (based on the influence of high temperatures);</p>

            <p>3) electrolytic corrosion with partial or complete immersion in a moving or stationary environment</p>

            <p>4) erosive formations (fretting);</p>

            <p>5) cavitation corrosion;</p>

            <p>6) abrasive wear of the equipment;</p>

            <p>7) contact corrosion;</p>

            <p>8) crevice corrosion;</p>

            <p>9) thermal contact corrosion, associated with simultaneous exposure to both high temperatures and uneven heating.</p>
	    <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The production cycle of granulated sugar itself has seven stages (Fig. 3).</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Referring back to Fig. 4, it can be emphasized that it is the diffusion sap that is the most aggressive medium of influence on metal surfaces. Next in terms of aggressiveness is the crude and clarified standard syrup (before the evaporation process). Fig. 5 shows the same impeller before operation.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thus, it can be emphasized that the rate of corrosion action is significantly predetermined by the level of acidity of the environment. The results of the analysis reveal a pattern between the level of susceptibility of individual steel alloys to corrosion in one or another acid medium.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The rate of corrosion processes in the solutions tested and at high temperature significantly exceeds the level accepted as normal. In fact, this shows that the most destructive, relative to the low level of acidity of the medium, are the working solutions and the acids contained in them used in the various stages of the production process. An additional intensifying factor in this case is the high temperature.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Moreover, at various stages of sugar production, various aggressive elements - proteins, amino acids, calcium oxide, carbonation gas, pectin substances, hydrogen sulfide, sulfuric acid, oxalic acid and many others - are added to the already existing aggressive environment. It is also important to emphasize that those samples tested in the most aggressive environments (diffusion juice and standard-syrup) were, in addition, subjected to ulcerative corrosion, which indicates that long-term operation of sugar factory production equipment can be a catastrophic problem.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It is necessary to consider special protective coatings as the main way to overcome the effects of aggressive media on metal surfaces. On top of everything else, they allow to additionally slow down the course of corrosive processes. Stressing the importance of works on It is important to understand that corrosion protection of the equipment is very labor-intensive. It comes from a whole system of primary reasons:</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>- The short time frame in which all the relevant procedures;</p>

            <p>- a large number of places that are difficult to access for the application of protective coatings.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>At the same time, modern technologies and technical solutions that are used company StroyPromSnab LLC, allow to fully eliminate the negative influence of the above factors, and thus increase the effectiveness of implementation corrosion protection procedures. Such solutions help to reduce the level of production losses of domestic sugar refineries, connected with the influence of corrosion processes.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In order to confirm the stated judgments we evaluated the economic feasibility of application of anticorrosion coatings in sugar factories on the example of the previously presented pump. The pump is one of the most important elements of the equipment, and their total number can reach up to eight pieces at one refinery. The service life of such a pump without protective coating is no more than 2 years, while some of its elements, such as the pump impeller, are subject to constant replacement - at least several times a year. At the time of the survey the market price of the SOT-60 pump body was about 140 thousand rubles, and the price of the wheel - 8 thousand rubles. The company spends at least 172 thousand rubles over 2 years to maintain the pump.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The cost of corrosion protection services, including sand blasting to Sa21/2 grade according to GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with multilayer corrosion protection coating of 200 micron thickness, amounts to about 60 thousand rubles. Implementation of protective procedures allows increasing the service life of the pump at least two times [4]. Economic effect from realization of such measures will make 166 thousand rubles for 2 years of operation.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As an additional example of economic efficiency let&#39;s give the following situation from the author&#39;s practice.</p>

            <p>The cost of transport system of diffusion apparatus DS-12 (Fig. 6, 7) is about 50 million rubles, the cost of dismantling and installation - 20 million rubles. Service life of such a system is only 4 years.</p>

            <p>In order to protect this element of the production complex using the previously described technology of multilayer 200-&micro;m thick coating, about 2 million rubles were spent.</p>

            <p>Actual calculations show that the implementation of anti-corrosion protection measures makes it possible to prolong the of service life of transport system at least twice [4]. Economic effect from implementation of protection measures amounted to about 68 million rubles during 8 years of operation.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thus, based on the results of the analysis of corrosion processes for internal metal surfaces of equipment, we can emphasize that, indeed, corrosion is one of the significant types of production losses, which ultimately reduce the profitability of production. The rate of occurrence of corrosion processes varies depending on the aggressiveness of the environment - the most aggressive are diffusion juice and standard-syrup.</p>

            <p>In addition, it was reflected that the issues of using protective anti-corrosion coatings have a really high degree of relevance, which comes from the possibility of reducing the corrosion rate, obtaining a high economic effect from the use of protective coatings. All this allows to emphasize that the application of special coatings is really expedient for sugar factories, at least in the case of those surfaces that are exposed to aggressive environments.</p>
