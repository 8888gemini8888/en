        <p><strong>Corrosion protection of technological equipment: the main features and economic benefits of application in production</strong><br />
            &nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Maintaining</strong></p>
            
            <p>To date, the rate of sugar production in the Russian Federation is increasing. The active policy of some companies is to expand production, increase the volume of sales of products, and increase net profit. However, to achieve these results in the future is only possible with the proper organization of management activities, including in terms of enterprise services.<br />
            It is up to the company&#39;s management to take timely measures to prevent the destruction of equipment.<br />
            In an era of acute cash shortages due to the crisis of many companies, an important factor is the preservation of current fixed assets of the company by reducing the amount of depreciation of production. As practice shows, the service life of equipment is shortened under the influence of various circumstances: improper operation, lack of proper and timely maintenance, human influence, load and time of use, and its quality. It is worth noting that the most rapid wear and tear of technological equipment production occurs due to corrosion, which can damage as insignificant (easily replaceable) parts of the equipment, and important, expensive parts and mechanisms. In some cases, the rapid deterioration of equipment is due to the specific industries in the absence of anti-corrosion treatment of metals. Often the management of enterprises tends to unreasonably save money by not providing equipment corrosion protection at the proper level, which in the long term leads to a huge increase in the cost of its replacement as a whole. Of course, corrosion protection does not guarantee eternal safety of the equipment, but it can significantly extend its life. It should be noted that with the rising prices of imported goods and the lack of domestic counterparts, the expenditure items in the budget of the enterprise when replacing technological equipment increases several times.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Justification of the expediency of corrosion protection of equipment</strong></p>
            
            <p>We have analyzed multiple aspects of technological equipment protection, as well as calculation of economic benefits of corrosion protection application at sugar production enterprises. In order to select the basic methodology, we conducted an analysis of literary sources, applied methods of observation, comparison and abstraction. The method of complex mathematical analysis was used to calculate the economic benefit. The above methodology is used in the overall system as a set of interrelated elements. Today, companies pursue an active policy to increase profits and long-term planned cost reductions, while often neglecting the technological protection of equipment. Managers of various enterprises note that many protective measures have a high cost, which cannot be justified during the year of economic activity. For example, many companies refuse to properly maintain equipment, which leads to irreversible consequences: at a minimum, the production components become unusable, and at a maximum, this process is accompanied by human losses [1]. In the context of the topic, it is important to consider the need to protect process equipment from corrosion in the production of sugar refinery.<br />
            As is known, sugar production is one of the most aggressive in terms of corrosion of equipment, because the process of sugar production takes place in several stages, each of which is accompanied by the formation of any aggressive environment, which has a devastating effect on the expensive products.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The main factors of wear and tear of equipment in sugar production</strong></p>
            
            <p>Based on the cycle of beet processing in a sugar refinery, there are several major factors in the rapid deterioration of equipment:<br />
            &ndash; high temperature exposure;<br />
            &ndash; release of various chemicals that destroy the protective layers of the metal;<br />
            - high rates of continuous production - four to seven months.</p>
            
            <p>The impact on the equipment during sugar beet processing leads to corrosion of different types: chemical, gas, contact, thermal contact, abrasion, cavitation, erosion, etc. Each of them requires a special treatment approach.<br />
            At the same time the increased wear and tear of the equipment due to the impact of aggressive substances simply dictates to the company management the need for timely, albeit expensive, protection of production lines, in case of failure of which the company risks not only to lose most of the equipment, but also to stop production completely, which will also entail huge costs. Corrosion and abrasion drastically reduces the life of the equipment, metals under its influence are destroyed rapidly, and if the damage is not detected in time, the technical means must be completely replaced. This situation leads to a high increase in direct costs. Along with this there are indirect losses associated with the impact of metals on the product of processing (in our case sugar solutions), which sometimes reach a sum higher than the cost of repair of equipment.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Methods and techniques of anti-corrosion protection</strong></p>
            
            <p>At the present stage, corrosive effects on process equipment, along with structural metals, are becoming a very acute engineering problem. Due to the above factors, there is an urgent need to increase the wear resistance and durability of the equipment, which is facilitated by active corrosion protection. The enterprise should either conduct its own research in this area or turn to private verified organizations that provide this service.&nbsp;<br />
            There are several basic and most effective ways to solve this problem.<br />
            1. Application of inhibitors. This method makes it possible not to rebuild the overall scheme of the technological production system and not to incur significant costs for the enterprise. It allows the use of fairly inexpensive (relatively special) structural metals. At the same time, its use when introduced into food products is not possible (clearly prohibited by the sanitary and state requirements on quality standards for the manufacture of products). However, it is possible to preserve the protective layer of the metal with the help of inhibitors for a long time.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Inhibitors are used in a wide range of industries:</strong><br />
            &ndash; acid washings of technological equipment (scale removal, mineral deposits);<br />
            &ndash; in the protection of the water supply (both industrial and domestic);<br />
            &ndash; in the sugar industry (when cleaning various containers intended for storage and transportation of the contents); &ndash; in cooling systems of technological equipment (protection against atmospheric corrosion).&nbsp;<br />
            In general, the very process of inhibitor application reflects a high degree of corrosion protection. According to the results of the study of corrosion protection activity of inhibitors and their concentrates it was recommended to use them for protection of mechanisms in food production [2]. The authors emphasize not only sufficiently high efficiency of the inhibitor-concentrate, but also its applicability to the food industry enterprises, including sugar production.<br />
            2. Use of passivators &ndash; highly effective method for neutral aquatic environment. Passivators are inorganic substances with a certain set of redox properties, which change the corrosion potential by passivation of metal. As noted earlier, sugar production is characterized by an extremely high degree of aggressiveness of the environment, which emphasizes the impossibility or limited use of passivators [3].<br />
            3. Zinc surface protection is widely used by many companies. However, there are some limitations - the wear resistance of zinc decreases when exposed to aggressive environments (especially in water, acidic and alkaline environments). High temperatures are also detrimental to the protective layer of zinc - at temperatures up to 70 there is the highest risk of occurrence of corrosion of the metal. [4].<br />
            4. Application of paint and varnish materials in anticorrosive treatment. This method is one of the most popular and effective (and relatively low-cost). Application of paints and varnishes depends on the type, composition, manufacturer and specific purpose [5]. For example, the use of varnish KHS-76 is possible in the food industry. This coating protects against acids, alkalis, aggressive gases. The result and the quality of the application of coatings for corrosion protection often depends on the specific service provider. It should be noted that the method of applying coating materials on a previously prepared surface is particularly effective and at the same time less costly for the company.<br />
            The direct algorithm of conducting of anti-rust works is as follows:<br />
            &ndash; Specialist visit to the enterprise in order to assess the pavement to be restored and determine the possibility and need for preparatory and follow-up work. Often this stage is implemented in the context of calling a specialist at the end of the warranty period of previous work for an inspection for further execution of the contract;<br />
            &ndash; surface preparation by treatment (mechanical, chemical or thermal);<br />
            &ndash; priming and puttying the surface;<br />
            &ndash; applying paint coatings (taking into account the specific conditions, environment and other factors).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Comparative analysis of production costs</strong></p>
            
            <p>Economic calculations are based on two Russian sugar refineries:<br />
            - CJSC &quot;Sugar Refinery Tikhoretskiy&quot;. The enterprise is a part of JSC &quot;Agrocomplex&quot; named after N.I. Tkachev, which corresponds to the top-5 ranking of the largest Russian producers of sugar sand;<br />
            &ndash; OJSC Valuikisakhar. It is a part of the Rusagro Holding, one of the leading beet sugar producers in the Russian Federation. The plant is coordinated by Rusago-Center LLC, whose activities are aimed at increasing the total volume of sugar production, expanding production lines, developing the sales market [6].<br />
            In order to calculate the economic benefits, an analysis of both individual production complexes in terms of a comparison of the cost of their protection (taking into account the protection period, the need for re-treatment, complexity and other factors), and possible depreciation losses associated with complete or partial replacement of equipment was made. Note that the calculation of economic benefits excludes the factor of loss arising from production downtime, because the cycle of sugar production is from four to seven months (it is assumed that active anti-corrosion operations will be carried out in the non-production period).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cost Stages</strong></p>
            
            <p>1. Calling an inspector does not always require additional funds - the maximum cost can vary in the range of 20 thousand rubles (for transportation costs and payment for housing).<br />
            2. The work of abrasive surface cleaning is the most materially and labor cost part of corrosion protection, because it includes the cost of materials, directly on the process and the cleaning of the room from the spent abrasive material. During the work material consumption varies from 10 to 30 kg /m2. For example, the quality cleaning of the diffuser DS-12 with an area of 1,500 m2 will require from 15 to 40 tons of couperslag or nickelslag. In this case, the surface cleaning rate is from 5 to 15 m2/h. It should be noted that the use of silica sand threatens the risk of lung silicosis, so it is not used in the course of work. Quality degree of coating cleaning (Sa-2 or Sa-2.5) without which the main work - the application of paint materials can not be made, requires a high consumption of abrasive material.<br />
            3. Priming the surface (with one layer) on average costs 400 r/m2.<br />
            4. The cost of applying paint directly depends on the degree of cleaning, the manufacturer and the price of the paint, as well as the warranty formed.<br />
            The average consumption for applying one layer of paint is 300 g/m2. Three to four layers will require 750 to 1000 g/m2 of material. Here is a typical example: if you clean the surface to a degree Sa-2, followed by the application of the minimum thickness of paint coatings in the dry condition of 180 microns and a guarantee on the coating in two production seasons will cost 1500 r/m2 treated surface. With a degree of cleaning Sa-2,5 (about 95% of clean surface), dry paint thickness of 250 microns and with a guarantee of three production seasons (the duration of one season, usually from five to six months) price of 2000 rubles/m2 (prices are excluding VAT). As a specific example of equipment treated against corrosion is the diffuser DS-12. The approximate amount of work is about 1500 m2 [7].</p>
            
            <p><br />
            Here are economic calculations of the cost of anti-corrosion treatment (excluding VAT):<br />
            1) with the degree of cleaning Sa-2, dry surface thickness of 180 microns and warranty for two production seasons the costs are:<br />
            1,500 &times; 1,350 = 2,250,000 rubles (2.25 million rubles). This should also include additional reserve costs about 200 thousand rubles. Total 2,45 mil. r.;<br />
            2) with the degree of cleaning of Sa-2.5, a dry surface thickness of 250 microns and a warranty for three production seasons, the costs are:<br />
            2000 &times; 1500 = 3 mil r. Similarly to the previous method, taking into account possible additional costs, the amount of costs will be 3,2 mil. r.<br />
            If we consider each of the degrees of protection in the context of the cost by season, we get the picture shown in Fig. 1.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />

            <p><img alt="Fig. 1. The cost of one year of corrosion protection of equipment" src="http://www.akz23.ru/en/images/Internal_.png" style="height:500px; width:475px" title="Fig. 1. The cost of one year of corrosion protection of equipment" /></p>
            Fig. 1. The cost of one year of corrosion protection of equipment: 1) the cost of one production season will cost the company about 1.225 million rubles; 2) the cost of one production season will be about 1.066 million rubles.</p>
            
            <p><br />
            It should be taken into account that if you choose the second option, the quality of performance of the service provided increases due to a higher degree of abrasive surface cleaning, meanwhile the cost of corrosion protection is reduced by 160 thousand rubles per year. Over 12 years of using Sa-2.5 protection, the consumer will be able to save about 1,900 thousand rubles. Thus, according to the results of the overall economic analysis, the second option of cleaning and surface treatment of equipment becomes the most effective.<br />
            The cost of just one DS-12 unit at retail price ranges from 2.5 to 3 million euros (210-255 million rubles), depending on the initial capacity, manufacturer and exchange rate. To date, the diffusion for DS-12 is made of carbon steel only in Poland. The cost of a used diffuser DS-12 is two to four times lower.<br />
            Sometimes a company buys a diffuser, expecting to use it from 20 to 30 years, which is higher than the warranty period. This life can only be extended by timely maintenance, including corrosion protection. The operating time shows the direct benefit of its use. It should be taken into account that the cost of the equipment is specified without taking into account delivery, supplier, installation, maintenance of technical and accounting documentation (the basis of the calculation is 20 years of service and the cost of the unit equal to 50 million rubles), the possible need to suspend production and other multiple cost factors. For example, to maintain a minimum 30-year service life of the diffuser with regular work on corrosion protection will cost on average about 31-32 million rubles (which is comparable to the cost of one-eighth of a new diffuser DS-12). If do not provide appropriate work, the impact of corrosive environment will quickly lead to the loss of equipment, which will come earlier than 15 years of service - this will lead to higher costs for the purchase of new equipment DS-12, taking into account all of the above nuances.</p>
            
            <p><br />
            Thus, the enterprise has two ways:<br />
            1) carry out anti-corrosion protection of equipment, the cost of which will be about 1 million rubles per year;<br />
            2) upgrade equipment every 12-20 years with a minimum maintenance cost of 16 million rubles per year.<br />
            The economic benefit of maintaining production equipment for a long time becomes obvious, which in the long term will reduce the total cost of the enterprise by several times. Work on corrosion protection should be carried out by proven individuals who will be able to provide the company with appropriate guarantees.<br />
            The other side of calculating the economic feasibility of measures for corrosion protection is an assessment of the condition of the equipment in cases where it is protected and in cases where there is no protection. You can come to a certain conclusion by applying the method of assessing the economic depreciation of equipment [8]. It is important to take into account the economic depreciation calculated by the formula<br />
            Dm=((Cb-Cc))/Cc 100%,</p>
            
            <p>where<br />
            Dm &ndash; depreciation of equipment;&nbsp;<br />
            Cb &ndash; initial cost;&nbsp;<br />
            Cc &ndash; recovery cost.</p>
            
            <p>It is necessary to reflect economic depreciation of equipment during each five years of operation (on the basis of 50 million - cost of used equipment):<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;without any protective measures with a period of operation:<br />
            &ndash; 5 years: Dm = (50 &ndash; 16,5) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 67 %;<br />
            &ndash; 10 years: Dm = (50 &ndash; 33) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 34 %;<br />
            &ndash; 15 years: Dm= (50 &ndash; 49,5) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 1 %;<br />
            2) at the cost of corrosion protection with a period of operation:<br />
            &ndash; 5 years: Dm = (50 &ndash; 5,33) / 50 ∙100 % = 89,34 %;<br />
            &ndash; 10 years: Dm = (50 &ndash; 10,66) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 78,68 %;<br />
            &ndash; 15 years: Dm = (50 &ndash; 16) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 68 %.<br />
            The graph of the equipment status is shown in Fig. 2.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>According to the data obtained, we can clearly trace a high degree of wear of the equipment, especially increasing after 10 years of operation. Corrosion protection measures smooth out the wear schedule, making it more linear towards the original condition. However, the present model does not take into account the devastating effects of corrosive environments on sugar production equipment, which emphasizes the higher degree of its real wear and tear.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Thus, the research results reflect the high relevance of the stated topic. Undoubtedly, the protection of technological equipment of sugar production is necessary, as it allows the company to significantly reduce the upcoming costs.
