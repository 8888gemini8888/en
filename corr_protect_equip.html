<p><em>Yuri Batsko inspector for visual and measuring quality control of painting, chief executive StroyPromSnab LLC, Krasnodar</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our company StroyPromSnab LLC, Krasnodar, has more than 10 years of experience in corrosion protection of steel structures in the oil and gas industry, bridge structures and equipment of sugar refinery plants. Just about the problems of corrosion of equipment in the sugar industry and methods of corrosion protection of equipment and will be our report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sugar production is one of the most underrated industries among manufacturers of coatings, in which corrosion causes perhaps the most severe damage to equipment, resulting in significant economic costs to agro-industrial enterprises in Russia for the repair and replacement of expensive equipment. This report is intended primarily for the management and technical specialists of paint and coat manufacturers and sugar refinery plants management. The aggressive environment of the operation of sugar plants equipment is due to the fact that the production of beet sugar occurs in several stages, and each stage for corrosion protection coating is extreme, such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>1.  The temperature in sugar production at different stages varies from 10<sup>o</sup> С to 120<sup>o</sup> С.</li>
	<li>2. At different stages of sugar production, such aggressive elements are added or produced as - proteins, amino acids, calcium oxide (burnt lime), pectin substances, CO2 (saturation gas), organic acids, ammonia, sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, barometric water, sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, calcium hydroxide, saponins, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), sulfur oxide (SO2), PH - 4-6, which are also extreme conditions of equipment operation.</li>
	<li>3. Continuous production cycle. From the seasonal start-up of the plant, the continuous production process (depending on the sugar beet crop) lasts from 4 to 7 months.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the known types of corrosion are encountered in the sugar production process, such as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>1. Chemical corrosion.</li>
	<li>2. Gas corrosion - occurring at high temperatures.</li>
	<li>3. Corrosion in electrolytes (salts, acids, alkalis) by total, partial or periodic immersion, in a moving or resting environment.</li>
	<li>4. Fretting-corrosion or corrosion erosion (with simultaneous effects of corrosive medium and frictional forces) - all processes are accompanied by mechanical effects, from the movement of liquid contents from one equipment to another, both by pressure distillation and diffusion method (sugar beet chips are mechanically moved by screws).</li>
	<li>5. Corrosion by cavitation (impact of corrosive environment) - movement of liquid components is carried out by means of pumps, which adds cavitation effects to the process of impact on the equipment.</li>
	<li>6. Abrasion - In beet wash pumps that draw water from reservoirs, the abrasion of sandy suspended solids from reservoirs is added to cavitation.</li>
	<li>7. Contact corrosion (corrosion that occurs when metals with different potentials come into contact).</li>
	<li>8. Crevice corrosion (occurring in narrow gaps and gaps between individual parts).</li>
	<li>9. Thermal contact corrosion (occurring due to temperature rupture caused by uneven heating of the metal surface).</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The process of corrosion protection of equipment in sugar refineries is also very complex. Here such factors come into play as:</p>

<ol>
	<li>1. Short period of time allotted for corrosion protection of equipment.</li>
	<li>2. Performance of work in very &quot;cramped&quot; conditions. Since all sugar production equipment is inside metal-filled, then to the high professional requirements of sandblasters and painters, have to add such a requirement as - &quot;slimness&quot;, and in the literal sense of &quot;flexibility&quot; of the employee, because of the very cramped conditions of work (Fig. 1). However, all these difficulties of doing the work, prompted us to a number of technological solutions and inventions, which we have implemented at our enterprise, and now they are undergoing the procedure of certification in the RosPatent.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is an example of the economic benefits of corrosion protection for one small but important in the production of sugar - SOT-60 pump. (Fig. 2) The normal service life (without corrosion protection) of the pump casing is 2 years, the service life of the pump impeller is a minimum of 2 pieces per year (in the process of one month&#39;s operation, there is virtually nothing left of the impeller not protected by corrosion protection). The cost of the pump casing is 40,000.00 rubles; the cost of one pump impeller is 8,000.00 rubles. Sandblasting to degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with the application of corrosion protection on the inside surface of the pump and the full surface of the impeller costs the customer 3,000.00 rubles. Sandblasting to degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with the application of corrosion protection on the inner surface of the pump and the full surface of the impeller, even with a minimum warranty period of 2 years, would save the factory from one pump 69 000.00 rubles per year: 40 000.00 rubles (pump cost) + 32 000.00 rubles (cost of 4 impellers) = = 72 000.00 rubles - 3.000 rubles (the cost of corrosion protection for the entire pump) = 69.000 rubles (benefit in 2 years). That is, the corrosion protection of the internal surfaces of the pump and impeller, at a cost of 3,000.00 rubles, the service life of parts doubled and will save the customer 69,000.00 rubles per pump for 2 years of operation. And there are at least 8 pumps in a plant. What to say about such complex and important equipment in sugar production as diffusers. Imaginary savings in choosing between high-quality and cheap (low-quality) anti-corrosion protection of this equipment will inevitably cost the customer several million rubles to repair the equipment, as all of the above extreme conditions for half a season of operation, lead to through fistulas in the metal walls and deep ulcerous lesions on the entire inner surface of diffuser, pipes and coils. Thus, it is easy to calculate how much money the customer will save on the purchase of obsolete equipment due to the momentary &quot;savings&quot;, abandoning the quality anti-corrosion protection of equipment.</p>

<p>We want to draw attention to this industry manufacturers of paints, because in spite of our many years of experience in corrosion protection in this industry, the maximum warranty on the coating we can give 3-4 years. And it took us several years before we found, by trial and mistakes (and mistakes in our work are fraught with penalties in case of non-compliance with the warranty period), worthy manufacturers of paints and varnishes. Despite this fact, the question of protecting the metal from cavitation in the presence of low pH and high temperatures is still open. The main purpose of this report is a way to establish communication bridges between the producer of paints, the contractor corrosion protection and the customer of the corrosion protection works. I would also like to appeal to the Owners and Managers who produce paints and varnishes on behalf of performers of work on corrosion protection, again based on my own experience and the experience of colleagues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem of the issue is that, the competence of managers of some plants for the production of paints and varnishes is at a low level. When contacting managers of plants-manufacturers of paints and varnishes with a request to help in the selection of paint schemes for this or that equipment, describing the operating conditions, it is often impossible to get complete, comprehensive information. Contractors of corrosion protection works often have the opinion that the producer of paints and varnishes does not want to participate in the process of improving their products. At the stages of selection of corrosion protection schemes we had to deal with such a phenomenon as unscrupulous manufacturers of paints. This fact cannot help but be depressing., it is not enough to get a certificate of quality from the producer of coatings, or rather getting a quality certificate from the manufacturer of the products can not be a guarantee that the material meets the stated characteristics in the GOST, or TU. And it is good, if the inconsistent quality is detected before the stage of application of the paintwork material on the prepared (in our case, cleaned to a degree Sa-2 &frac12; of GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014) surface, but not in the process, or the end of the technological process of sugar production, as in the second case the Manufacturer of corrosion protection works will bear financial losses to restore the corrosion-resistant protective coating within the warranty obligations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we have encountered the fact that the information contained in the Technological Chart about the methods of applying paints and varnishes to surfaces may not correspond to reality. In connection with these circumstances, the question of creating some kind of Association of conscientious manufacturers of paints and varnishes becomes relevant. Like, for example, builders have SRO, NOSTROI, which is a guarantee that the organization has professionals in the field of construction. In my opinion the creation of the Association, in the first place, should be interested in the manufacturers of paints and varnishes, as, in addition to major customers such as &quot;Transneft&quot;, &quot;Lukoil&quot;, &quot;Gazpromneft&quot;, etc., there are many customers from other businesses, which are in need of quality coatings, but alas, do not have the opportunity to have their own laboratories to test paint, to train their employees in nondestructive testing of coatings. And for these customers would be a huge help such an Association of conscientious manufacturers of paints and varnishes. And they would direct their finances to the purchase of known-quality paints and coatings, thereby saving themselves from litigation with unscrupulous manufacturers of paints and coatings, and from the costly costs of repeated repairs of equipment and repeated anti-corrosion protection. I would also like to mention the &quot;desirable-mandatory&quot; dialogue between the producer of paints and varnishes and us - the executors of works on corrosion protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our company StroyPromSnab LLC, like many others, seeks to gain new knowledge, to train their employees to work with technical innovations in terms of surface preparation and application of materials. It would be great if paint manufacturers introduced us to their materials, both new and those that have proven themselves on the market. At such meetings, presentations, together we could be very useful to each other! For example, often the managers of paints and coatings manufacturers do not know or do not want to know even in theory, what is the difference between air spraying methods and airless spraying of coatings, what is the difference in degree of cleaning Sa-2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 etc. Managers of the manufacturer will be able to visually understand how their materials work in practice. For the workers, it will give them the opportunity to understand the peculiarities of working with a particular material. After all, not all manufacturers of paints include a professional painter who tests materials using different methods of application with the latest paint sprayers, nozzles and application conditions. Neither do corrosion protection contractors have a paint technologist on staff, because the knowledge of a paint inspector is sometimes insufficient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing the topic of unfairness, I would like to note that there are a lot of unfair organizations among contractors on corrosion protection who use the fact that the Customer often has a very superficial knowledge in the field of corrosion protection (despite the acute problem of corrosion in the sugar industry) and pass off poor-quality work as high-quality. For example, cleaning of the inner surface of diffuser DS-12 of 1500 m2, affected by solid corrosion degree D, with numerous ulcers up to 4 millimeters deep, such performers allegedly clean the metal surface to a degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014, 2 tons of abrasive!!! And this at a nominal consumption of abrasive for this degree of corrosion damage 25-30 kg/m2! Thus, any cleaning of the metal surface to a degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 is out of the question, such a cleaning is not even &quot;pulling&quot; on the light sweeping, and is a deception of the customer. In 2020, when sandblasting the inner surface of the pulp-press water collector (previously painted by unscrupulous contractors), our organization encountered a record consumption of abrasive, which amounted to 100 kg/m2 ! The depth of corrosion of the metal was up to 5 millimeters, in some places there were through fissures (Fig. 3). This fact was a consequence of the fact that the previous unscrupulous contractors had not properly prepared the surface before applying the paint, namely, the paint was applied to a poorly prepared surface (the surface was not cleaned of mill scale and corrosion).</p>

<p>Fig. 3. Consequences of coating over mill scale</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On many occasions, we observe a situation where there is no preparation of the previously painted surface at all, and we see a kind of &quot;multilayer pie of paint coatings,&quot; which were applied over previous layers of paintwork and without removing the corrosion (Fig. 4).</p>

<p>Fig. 4. Multilayer paintwork, applied annually without removing previous layers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This coating to the average person from a distance seems integral, but in fact resembles poorly glued wallpaper, which can be effortlessly, in large fragments, separate from the metal. Such a coating has almost no adhesion to the metal and corrosion processes proceed unhindered under it (Fig. 5).</p>

<p>Fig. 5. Peeling coating applied to an unprepared surface</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the sugar industry, the fight against such contractors is simple, with the help of &quot;word of mouth&quot; as all plants are in contact with each other at the level of managers. In exactly the same way information about quality paintwork materials and anticorrosive protection contractors is disseminated. Another problem in this direction is the management of customers (sugar refineries). On the one hand, they help to save money for the Beneficiaries by choosing the cheapest corrosion protection service, but they also bring even more losses to the Beneficiaries by having to spend not on corrosion protection, but on expensive repairs to replace the metal structures of the equipment, which have deteriorated due to poor quality of corrosion protection of the equipment. This, alas, is the reason why specialists who organize purchases are often not very familiar with sugar production technology and, moreover, have little idea of the specifics of anti-corrosion protection works. And the only criterion for choosing corrosion protection services of such managers is a low price, but as we know &quot;cheap&quot; is often synonymous to the word &quot;low-quality&quot;. At those enterprises where there is direct contact between the management of the plant and the beneficiaries, there is an opportunity to convey a reasonable idea of what quality corrosion protection is - when expensive technological equipment is preserved and expensive metal elements do not have to be replaced or replaced every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our company is now working on bringing to a single standard for corrosion protection works in sugar production, so that such a standard would become a handbook for the management of sugar refineries. We were motivated to create such a handbook for sugar factory managers by the lack of knowledge of the Customer of corrosion protection works where we have to explain and prove the facts which are well known and are axiomatic in the oil and gas sector. For example, such as: new metal must be cleaned of mill scale before painting - this operation is perceived by the Customer at sugar refineries as imposing an additional operation. This also applies to the number/thickness of layers of paint, and the timing of polymerization of the coating before the commissioning of the equipment. In connection with this fact, and at the numerous requests of sugar refinery managers, our company has decided to create such a Guidebook on corrosion protection for sugar refineries. In conclusion of the report, we would like to draw attention of the Customers to the obligatory qualitative work on corrosion protection, it has obvious economic benefit for the Customer. Producers of paints and varnishes and performers of corrosion protection works should educate the Customers of corrosion protection works about the fact that by purchasing more expensive, but high-quality corrosion protection works performed by quality paintwork materials the Customer saves money on premature repairs of equipment that would have become worthless under the influence of corrosion. Customers of works on corrosion protection, to be more careful in selecting contractors of corrosion protection, and be guided not only by the cheap cost of the work. Draw the attention of manufacturers of paints and varnishes to the symbiosis and cooperation with performers of works on corrosion protection, to combine practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Producers of paints and coatings should consider the possibility of establishing the Association of bona fide manufacturers of paints and varnishes.</p>
