    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Consideration is given to the activities of the paint inspector in the context of the engineering of the future enterprise. Analyzes the theoretical aspects of the problems faced by the enterprise in the absence of taking into account the effects of corrosion on the condition of fixed assets. At the same time, the author calculates the economic benefit of the activities of the paint and varnish inspector in the context of preventing global costs associated with the impact of corrosion on the condition of the objects of fixed assets.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
	    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The modern means connected with the crisis situation of many enterprises of the money shortage in Russia, underscores the importance and urgency of the problem of planning in advance for costs associated with the activities; such an approach will allow for a greater of possible unforeseen expenditures and create all the necessary reserves in time. At the same time, the greatest efficiency of these processes can be obtained only in case of initial formation of complex systemic measures and mechanisms providing for multiple ways of protection of the enterprise.</p>
    
    <p>The problem of corrosion has always been a topical issue, since it is the one that brings high economic damage to many production enterprises. Corrosion affects not only equipment, but also important technological facilities, storage facilities, pipes and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, corrosion products in the case of its occurrence in the enterprises of the agro-industrial sector can may end up in food. In addition, the aggressive influence of external factors associated with the process of production and manufacturing of products, often increases the rate of corrosion processes [2]. To prevent them, there are many studied and scientifically proven ways, but in modern studies the fact that the greatest opportunities to prevent corrosive effects exist only in the case of planned and structured design of enterprise infrastructure, taking into account all possible factors and risks from activities, including the corrosion of metal structures and equipment itself, is not touched upon.</p>
    
    <p>Thus, the purpose of this article is to conduct a theoretical and practical analysis of the need to involve a paint inspector in the planning process of an enterprise, as well as to consider the overall economic benefits of this process from the standpoint of preventing corrosive effects.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><img alt="Fig. 2. Cost of work without a paint inspector" src="http://www.akz23.ru/en/images/fig2_Cost_o_work_without_inspector.png" style="height:500px; width:475px" title="Fig. 2. Cost of work without a paint inspector" /></p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><strong>Research Methodology</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the course of theoretical and practical analysis, the author uses a comprehensive methodology aimed at synthesizing information obtained on the basis of substantiated scientific literature. In addition, a special place in this article is occupied by the methods of abstraction, generalization, empirical research and the author&#39;s personal professional experience. When calculating economic benefits, the author relies on a complex mathematical apparatus.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><strong>Results and its discussion</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The construction of an enterprise is a very complex process, the competent implementation of which will determine the final functioning of the company from the position of the formed infrastructure, the presence of an established communication system, as well as the prevention of a number of possible problems associated with other factors (the characteristics of production, the environment - the landscape, the climate zone, the terrain and a number of others). In addition, as noted above, it is especially important in the formation of projects, which in the future will be the basis for the builders, to involve specialists from various fields of activity, who will be able to assess the current project and make their own adjustments to it from the perspective of a different approach to the analysis of the project [5].</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If we neglect the development of the project and do not use the proper amount of resources in this direction, then in the end of the construction may have very important architectural and engineering omissions, which subsequently lead to higher costs than those originally foreseen, because in this case, in addition to developing a new project will have to destroy old buildings or completely redesign them and therefore change some characteristics, which will also lead to additional costs.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is a complex formed project allows a clear approach to the assessment of the planned costs of construction, because in this case all aspects will be worked out in more detail; in addition, it will exclude many inaccuracies associated with the use of certain types of materials in non-standard conditions [9]. For this purpose, the quality control of the future construction object is carried out, which includes a number of measures:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Consideration of the requirements initially laid down in the project and their comparison with the current indicators on the project. Thus, the enterprise to be formed must comply with a multiple system of indicators based on the technological and economic components.</p>
    
    <p>2. Analytical evaluation of the quality of the solutions included in the project. This measure is aimed at identifying errors made during the design process: this allows you to eliminate them in a timely manner, which in the future will reduce the economic costs.</p>
    
    <p>3. Assessment of normative and technical documentation: all kinds of drawings, estimates, descriptions and calculations (including anti-corrosion measures).</p>
    
    <p>4. Identification and elimination of contradictions between the adopted design solutions and normative-technical documentation, which will significantly reduce not only the time of the project formation, but also take into account possible omissions [1, 6, 8].</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, today there are trends based on maximum economy in the preparation of project documentation, which causes a number of problems that lead to the unsuccessful implementation of the project, multiple attempts to start production, as well as reducing the efficiency of the system performance. In the design, a number of major problems can be identified that do not provide an opportunity to harmonize the project management process:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Insufficient design goal setting. This problem is based on the lack of a clear system of goals and objectives of project formation, following which the specialists will be able to achieve the intended plans. Besides, the absence of clear goal-setting impedes the accurate and profound elaboration of project details - this can become a reason for increased costs in the future.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>2. Errors of calculation in the budgeting of the project. Any entrepreneur/businessman strives to minimize expenses. However, when implementing projects, one should not tend to cut budgets unnecessarily - it often leads to high expenses, since it requires a reduction of construction costs, which is achieved by purchasing cheaper materials, tools and hiring less qualified specialists (&quot;cheap labor&quot;).</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>3. Reliance on a clear system of standards in the design, which covers all aspects of activity - from a rigid schedule of work during which all work must be done, to the deliberate reduction of work deadlines. This approach does not allow for the proper production of quality work, as it severely limits the output parameters during construction [10].</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>So, it is important to note that the solution of the above problems is the basis for the implementation of any project. However, in preventing them, it is necessary to focus on a more comprehensive multi-level elaboration of the system.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>From the position of formation of measures for corrosion protection, it is necessary to carry out consultation and evaluation and analytical work with the inspector of paint and varnish coating, which will be aimed at solving the above problems from the position:</p>
    
    <p>- orientation to ensure maximum protection of the enterprise from the effects of corrosion (in the context of goal-setting);</p>
    
    <p>- calculation of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the use of various corrosion protection measures, justification of the economic benefit of this measure, as well as the reflection of the benefits of timely protection of the enterprise from corrosion (in terms of the implementation of calculations);</p>
    
    <p>- taking into account the current quality standards set to the conditions of application of paint and varnish coating, compliance with all technological stages of processing (from primer coating to varnish coating) with their correlation with the possible variability of implementation of processing measures (since it is possible to shift the terms, for example, due to changes in weather conditions, etc.) [3].</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, the integration of the activities of several specialists who are able to analyze the problem from different perspectives is a rather promising measure, which should be implemented when carrying out design activities from the moment of &quot;laying the foundation&quot; of the future enterprise. In this case, even from the design stage, the structural deficiencies of certain aspects of the enterprise will be identified, which will be compensated by the proposed measures. For example, from the point of view of corrosion, it is planning taking into account its effects and the increase in the wear and tear (depreciation) of the enterprise&#39;s fixed assets; this approach is realized through the protection measures proposed by the paint inspector, depending on the effects of precipitation, the location of the object and its operating conditions (as well as a number of other possible factors).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, the coating inspector as well as other specialists must be present at the formation of the project, as only he can systematically approach the assessment of the risks of corrosion of metals, taking into account the climatic and weather conditions of the region in which the object will be constructed, the degree and amount of precipitation, which subsequently will affect the erected buildings, the structural features of metal structures, as well as the formation of the primary protection of objects from their effects. Thus the inspector&#39;s activity is multifaceted, based on risk assessment and the subsequent development of solutions to overcome them. Together with other participants, he justifies the feasibility of certain decisions taken in the formation of the project [7].</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The inspector&#39;s activity directly depends on the stage of project development: if the activity concerns the organization of the construction of new buildings and structures, the inspector acts as an advisory person, who proposes some adjustments to the project.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>During the implementation of the project, the same inspector can evaluate the quality of the implemented works, monitoring a number of parameters:</p>
    
    <p>- the quality of preparation of the surface of the steelwork;</p>
    
    <p>- the external quality and properties of the applied coatings;</p>
    
    <p>- the presence of defects in the applied coatings;</p>
    
    <p>- compliance with the principles of uniform and continuous painting of the surface.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>If we talk about the installation of new facilities or retrofitting of old buildings in the operation of an existing enterprise, the inspector implements control-evaluation functions in addition to design. For example, he performs visual and measuring inspection of metal structures and equipment of the enterprise for the presence and extent of corrosion processes, and furthermore, he also performs advisory/expert activities: forms general recommendations on the use of certain types of paintwork materials, assesses the cost of upcoming works (from processing and surface preparation of metal structures to the direct process of application of paintwork materials), is engaged in the documentation part [4].</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the involvement of a paint and varnish inspector for an enterprise, depending on the type of work performed, will have different costs. From the author&#39;s practice, we can note the fact that the very involvement of an inspector at the design stage costs about 40 thousand rubles.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The paint inspector&#39;s activity in the context of the whole design stage is not comparable with the possible consequences of corrosion effects - it often has an underestimated contribution. We can consider this side of the issue from the perspective of the construction of metal hoppers for barley storage (Fig. 1). It is known that to design an object it is necessary to apply to an architectural bureau, where architects will design the construction of this object, calculate loads, materials used; in addition, specialists in the field of metal structures will be involved, who will calculate what sort and according to what GOST should be laid in the project; specialists in welding of metal structures will be involved, as it is well known how important it is to competently calculate the thickness of weld, select a brand and type of electrodes, and to control the performance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this case, the attitude to corrosion protection of steel structures remains underestimated, although it is quality corrosion protection can significantly extend the life of steel structures. In practice, the author has often encountered the opinion that self-painting, performed by non-professionals, has almost the same effect as the professional one. However, this is often not the case. This is due to the fact that professional craftsmen know a lot of nuances and subtleties, without observing which the painted surface in the future will not be preserved as it will be with their consideration. In corrosion protection, the process of coating with paint material depends not only on the material itself and the experience of the specialist, but also on the equipment used.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In practice, the most frequent statements from customers are concerns about the preparation of new metal for painting, namely the removal of mill scale. This factor is very important in the application of painting materials, that is why from the point of view of clarity we will consider two examples - a real practical and theoretical, based on the construction of a 4000.00 m2 complex of steel hoppers for the storage of beer barley and malt.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Actual work experience - without involving an inspector. The cost of 1 m2 of hot-rolled sheet metal with a thickness of 5 mm, is 3200.00 rubles/m2. Due to the economy (as well as lack of understanding of the importance of these processes), the customer neglected such technological operations as degreasing, abrasive blast cleaning of steel structures and dedusting of the surface. In this case, the manufacturer of the paint, stressed in advance that it makes no sense to apply the paint on unprepared metal, as coating can begin to flake off immediately after drying.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For painting the customer has chosen an alkyd coating &quot;3 in 1&quot; in one layer with a thickness of a dry layer of 100 microns. The cost of materials and labor for application of one coat of paintwork materials was 280.00 rubles/m2.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Total: actual cost of 1 m2 of metal surface + work on application of one coat of paintwork was 3200,00 + 280,00 = 3480,00r/m2. The paint manufacturer gives a three-year warranty on the abovementioned paintwork with minimal preparation (degreasing and dusting) of the metal surface. However, since this fact was not taken into account by the client, the use of inexpensive material and its application over rusty, dust-free and non-greasy metal led to the appearance of corrosion in one month after the application of paint materials. For example, the cost of work on an area of 4,000 m2 is shown in Fig. 2:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1. Theoretical example - involving a paint inspector. In this case, all the recommendations from the inspector would have been taken into account in the design. The cost of 1 m2 of 5 mm thick hot-rolled metal sheet is 3,200.00 rubles/m2. The cost of attracting a corrosion protection inspector (ACP) for professional selection of a complex scheme of ACP with recommendations for surface preparation is 40,000 rubles, which in view of the total area of the metalware is equal to 10.00 rubles/m2.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Degreasing of metalwork will make 100.00 rubles/m2. The abrasive blasting of metal surface to grade Sa-21 / 5 ISO 8501-1: 1988; (NACE № 2) is on average 600.00 rub/m2, but such preparation of the surface of metal before the application of ACP will increase the service life of steelwork by 2-3 times (depending on conditions and operating environment). Dusting of metalwork will make 100,00 rub/m2. Three-layer quality paint coating with epoxy primer and polyurethane enamel (thickness of dry layer 120-150 microns) + work on the application of paintwork will cost 950.00 rubles/m2.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, a total of 1 m2 with abrasive blast cleaning of the metal surface and all the mandatory technological operations for ACP will cost 3200.00 + 10.00 + 100.00 + 600.00 + 100.00 + 950.00 = 4960.00 p / m 2. The maximum warranty period from the manufacturer of the paintwork for such a quality preparation of the metal surface is up to 20 years.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
	   
    <p>The illustrative cost of the work for 4000.00 m2 is shown in Fig. 3.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	     <p><img alt="Fig. 3. Cost of work when a paint inspector is involved" src="http://www.akz23.ru/en/images/Fig3_Cost_of_work_inspector_is_involved.png" style="height:500px; width:475px" title="Fig. 3. Cost of work when a paint inspector is involved" /></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>    
    <p>Thus, based on the above data, as well as the maximum warranty period for coatings, we can conclude that over the service life of 20 years, the metal structure, painted without the recommendations of the inspector, will have to be painted at least six more times.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Such additional painting will add to the cost of 1 m2 previously painted surface, at least cleaning with mechanical and manual tools to a degree St-2 ISO 8501-1:1988 previously applied coating, which in the operation of the object will become worthless due to the delamination of not removed scale and as a result, the lack of adhesion of paint coating with the metal surface, which will add to the cost of at least 200.00 rubles. for 1 m2 and will make 3480,00 + (200,00 + 280,00) &sdot; 6 coatings = 6360,00 rubles/m2. For 4000,00 m2 of surface it will make 25,44 million rubles. In this case this cost does not include inflation and increases in the cost of materials and works, as well as losses from downtime of technological equipment that will have to be taken out of operation during the painting work. Taking into account the above-mentioned factors, the final cost of works will increase even more.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, the lack/saving of a paint inspector at the formative stage of a project will result in higher costs in the long run for facility remediation and treatment. In the case where an inspector is involved in the design process, one-time costs are lower in the long run because they only include work to oversee the steel surface preparation and paint coating process and additional non-essential costs. Otherwise, the company either completely replaces the item of fixed assets or performs surface machining, to which the costs from the first option are added. It is important to evaluate the cost of the two approaches using an illustrative example (Fig. 4).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
	     <p><img alt="Fig. 4. Comparison of the cost of corrosion protection works per 1000 sq. m2." src="http://www.akz23.ru/en/images/Fig4_Comparison_cost_corrosion_protection_works.png" style="height:500px; width:475px" title="Fig. 4. Comparison of the cost of corrosion protection works per 1000 sq. m2." /></p>
	 p>&nbsp;</p>   
    <p>Thus, the cost of the work with the involvement of an ACS inspector will be 4960.00 rubles/m2, and without the involvement of such - 6360.00 rubles/m2. Losses of the Customer will be (6360,00-4960,00) &times; 4000,00 m2 = 5,600,000.00 rubles. I.e. having saved 40,000.00 rubles on attracting an inspector at the stage of architectural project development the Customer will incur losses of at least 5,600,000.00 rubles. And also, most likely, by the 20th year of operation of steel bins, taking into account the poor quality of corrosion protection, and as a consequence, regular exposure to corrosion on the surface of the metal, the metal structure will become worthless and will require replacement of a substantial part of the metal structure.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>But the most significant loss for the customer could be the loss of reputation and total collapse of the business due to the fact that the corrosion products get into the final product (in our example is the beer malt) and lead to the inability to sell the final product, and can also harm the health of consumers / human beings, and as a result lead to multi-million lawsuits from consumers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, the enterprise has a dilemma since the stages of designing - to make a clear planning without emphasis on reducing the cost of construction and involving a group of specialists who can calculate all the stages of design using a systematic approach; or, citing lack of funds, to purposefully underestimate the cost of project implementation (which is likely to eliminate multiple mechanisms of facilities protection, including corrosion), which in the future will lead to increased losses, the amounts of which (in case of the lack of funds) will be calculated on the basis of a systematic approach.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, the example of the conducted research clearly shows the necessity of advance planning of all possible scenarios and factors influencing the wear of fixed assets of the company.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All this will allow in the long term to not only systematically reduce the company&#39;s costs for restoration work, but also to increase the efficiency of production due to the absence of delays in production and downtime in the implementation of repair and construction work.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus the activity of a paint inspector has a high economic justification already at the design stages of the future buildings and facilities of a company. In addition, as the economic calculations show, in any case it will be more beneficial for the company to prevent corrosion than to fight corrosion all the time. In the author&#39;s opinion, the coating inspector is a really important specialist in the implementation of the project; this is due to the fact that only the coating inspector will be able to correctly implement all the functions relating to the corrosion protection technology, calculate the economic benefits of the measures implemented, as well as assure project managers of the effectiveness of the proposed protection measures.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, the design of future production is a multidimensional process that requires consideration of many factors, one of which is the impact of corrosion on the condition of fixed assets of the enterprise.</p>
