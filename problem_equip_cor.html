<p><strong>The problem of equipment corrosion in sugar refineries and ways to solve it</strong></p>

<p><br />
<em>Yuri Batsko inspector for visual and measuring quality control of painting, chief executive&nbsp;LLC StroyPromSnab, Krasnodar</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The environmental safety of the food industry requires preventing the contamination of food products with metallic impurities. Since the equipment of sugar factories is made mainly of carbon steel, iron contamination of products can occur through corrosion.<br />
If the iron content in human consumption of food or water is above the threshold limit value (TLV) (5-15 mg/kg), it accumulates in the body, causing diseases siderosis and hemosiderosis, which affects the liver and blood. In order to produce products without metallic impurities it is necessary to ensure high corrosion resistance of steel surfaces that come into contact with food media in the technological cycle [1]<br />
As required by GOST R 54762&not; 2011/ISO/TS 22002&not;1:2009 all &quot;surfaces in contact with foodstuffs must be impervious and free of rust or corrosion&quot; [2].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factors affecting the corrosion of equipment in sugar beet processing plants</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In sugar refineries, corrosion protection of diffusers, sulphite extractant collectors, pulp press water lines and collectors, accumulation collectors, supports of the pulp gallery and rake conveyors consists in the application of anti-corrosion coatings.<br />
The high requirements for corrosion protection coatings are due to the following aggressive environment in which equipment parts are operated in the production of beet sugar:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- temperature fluctuations in different stages from 10 to 120 &deg;C;<br />
- presence of dissociated organic acids;<br />
- action of inorganic substances and their salts;<br />
- a complex biochemical process;<br />
- oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases dissolved in the medium;<br />
- movement of the medium under pressure and agitation;<br />
- acidic environment (pH 4-6), in which iron corrodes much more intensively than in an alkaline environment [3, p. 6, 13].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prolonged contact of metal with aggressive environment because of the continuous production cycle, which lasts from 4 to 7 months, depending on the yield of sugar beets in the current year, intensifies the course of all corrosive processes.<br />
Most of the known types of corrosion occur in sugar production. Electrochemical corrosion in electrolytes (acids, salts and alkalis) is observed when parts are partially or completely immersed in the food medium, its rate increases with increasing temperature. The simultaneous action of the corrosive medium and frictional forces causes fretting corrosion when sugar beet chips mixed with water are moved by screws or by pressure distillation from one process unit to another. The impact of the liquid corrosive component of the technological process, which moves under pressure, causes corrosive cavitation. Because of the uneven heating of the metal surface, a thermal contact corrosion takes place, and if metals with different electrochemical potentials come into contact with each other, a contact corrosion takes place. Crevice corrosion occurs in gaps and crevices between parts. Since water is taken from water bodies for washing the beets, the abrasive effect of sand suspensions is added to cavitation [4].<br />
At high temperatures the most important type of chemical corrosion occurs - gas corrosion, when metal interacts with active gas media: water vapor, oxygen, hydrogen sulfide and other gases. Temperature fluctuations during heating (especially during alternate heating and cooling) cause destruction of oxide films and increase the rate of gas corrosion [5, p. 28].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ways to protect equipment from corrosion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main type of protection of technological equipment in the sugar industry - protective coatings intended to isolate the metal from direct contact with corrosive and aggressive environment, more resistant in this environment than the protected metal. Modern coatings provide protection that meets the requirements of operating conditions and durability.<br />
Paint and varnish coatings are cheaper than metal ones, easier to apply, more versatile; they do not change the properties of the coated metal. They are based on film-forming synthetic resins to which various combinations of fillers, plasticizers, solvents, catalysts and pigments are added. Insoluble pigments - titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum powder, chromium oxide and others, ground into a powder with particles from 0.5 to 5 microns, give coatings strength, hardness, heat resistance, color [6, p. 85-87].<br />
After the paint materials applied in a thin layer dries, a protective film is formed on the metal surface, held in place by adhesion forces.<br />
In order to improve the adhesion and respectively the corrosive properties of surfaces, their preparation for painting is carried out. Reliability and durability of protective coatings of metal structures largely depend on the method and quality of preparation [3, p. 28]. GOST 9.4022004 &quot;Unified system of protection against corrosion and aging&quot; prescribes the removal from the surface of all substances that contribute to corrosion and prevent coloring. The surface must be free of scale, rust, old paint residues, welding slag, castings burnout and other contaminants [7].<br />
New hot-rolled metal is always covered with scale, rust, dust and other contaminants appear on it during storage and transportation. Any scale and rust reduce the adhesion of the paint coating and become a focus of destruction of the coating and metal. Therefore, descaling and rust cleaning is a mandatory operation before painting immediately after delivery of new equipment parts made of steel [8, p. 85]. To ensure that the coating guaranteed adhesion and absolute protection of steel against corrosion, before its it is necessary to ensure the appropriate surface profile and degree of its cleaning.<br />
Compressed air abrasive blasting is used to clean metal of old coatings, rust and scale and to roughen it up. Cooperslag and nickelslag are the abrasives most suitable for cleaning sugar refinery equipment, including deep corrosion removal. By selecting the size of cuper slag granules, air pressure, distance and angle of the nozzle, cuts are made at a depth from 20 to 140 microns, depending on the paint material used. Sharp, angular pellets have the hardness of 6.5 on the Mohs scale [9, p. 17-19]. This makes it possible to achieve the purification degree<br />
Sa 2&frac12; GOST R ISO 8501.1.2014, when examination with the naked eye reveals no rust, scale, remains of old paint and other non-metallic inclusions [10]. Nickel slag has similar properties but higher hardness [9, p. 33]. Before abrasive cleaning the metal surfaces are degreased with a solvent, after it the surface is dusted with air under pressure. Corrosion protection coating usually consists of two layers of primer and a finishing layer of enamel. Specialists of LLC &quot;StroyPromSnab&quot; (Krasnodar) have developed and implemented a number of technological solutions and inventions, which are now being registered in Rospatent. The company is working on the creation of a unified standard for corrosion protection of sugar factory equipment [4]. Only ⅔ of the metal destroyed by corrosion can be put back into circulation by remelting. The rest of the metal, amounting to 10-15% of the volume of its annual production, is lost irretrievably. In addition to direct losses in the form of costs for repair or replacement of expensive equipment producers bear indirect financial losses due to emergency shutdowns of corrosion-damaged equipment and reduction of the grade of products contaminated by its products [6, p. 3, 5].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beet sugar industry is one in which corrosion is probably the most damaging to equipment. Corrosion protection of the metal surfaces of the processing equipment is definitely needed here. Corrosion protection can be ensured by proper surface preparation and the application of paint and varnish materials that are suitable for the operating conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abstract. The article deals with the problem of corrosion in the production of beet sugar in terms of improving the service life and environmental safety of technological equipment. The possibility of contamination of the food environment by corrosion products is noted. In addition, corrosion destruction of metal brings tangible losses to both individual enterprises and the industry as a whole. The main factors of aggressiveness of the environment in which equipment parts are operated, types of corrosion typical for sugar production are listed. Protective paint and varnish coatings, which isolate the metal surface from the corrosive and aggressive environment, are considered as the main protection. Particular attention is paid to the quality of surface preparation for painting, including for new equipment. The work of Krasnodar specialists on a unified standard of anticorrosive protective coatings in the sugar industry is noted.</p>
