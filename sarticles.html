	    <p class=" "> Corrosion protection of sugar refinery plants equipment 

	Yuri Batsko inspector for visual and measuring quality control of painting, chief executive 
	StroyPromSnab LLC, Krasnodar

	Our company StroyPromSnab LLC, Krasnodar, has more than 10 years of experience in corrosion protection of steel structures in the oil and gas industry, bridge structures and equipment of sugar refinery plants. Just about the problems of corrosion of equipment in the sugar industry and methods of corrosion protection of equipment and will be our report. Sugar production is one of the most underrated industries among manufacturers of coatings, in which corrosion causes perhaps the most severe damage to equipment, resulting in significant economic costs to agro-industrial enterprises in Russia for the repair and replacement of expensive equipment. This report is intended primarily for the management and technical specialists of Paint and Coat Manufacturers and Sugar refinery plants Management.
	The aggressive environment of the operation of sugar plants equipment is due to the fact that the production of beet sugar occurs in several stages, and each stage for corrosion protection coating is extreme, such as:
	1. The temperature in sugar production at different stages varies from 10o С to 120o С.
	2. At different stages of sugar production, such aggressive elements are added or produced as - proteins, amino acids, calcium oxide (burnt lime), pectin substances, CO2 (saturation gas), organic acids, ammonia, sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, barometric water, sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, calcium hydroxide, saponins, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), sulfur oxide (SO2), PH - 4-6, which are also extreme conditions of equipment operation.
	3. Continuous production cycle. From the seasonal start-up of the plant, the continuous production process (depending on the sugar beet crop) lasts from 4 to 7 months.

	Most of the known types of corrosion are encountered in the sugar production process, such as:
	1. Chemical corrosion.
	2. Gas corrosion - occurring at high temperatures.
	3. Corrosion in electrolytes (salts, acids, alkalis) by total, partial or periodic immersion, in a moving or resting environment.
	4. Fretting-corrosion or corrosion erosion (with simultaneous effects of corrosive medium and frictional forces) - all processes are accompanied by mechanical effects, from the movement of liquid contents from one equipment to another, both by pressure distillation and diffusion method (sugar beet chips are mechanically moved by screws).
	5. Corrosion by cavitation (impact of corrosive environment) - movement of liquid components is carried out by means of pumps, which adds cavitation effects to the process of impact on the equipment.
	6. Abrasion - In beet wash pumps that draw water from reservoirs, the abrasion of sandy suspended solids from reservoirs is added to cavitation.
	7. Contact corrosion (corrosion that occurs when metals with different potentials come into contact).
	8. Crevice corrosion (occurring in narrow gaps and gaps between individual parts).
	9. Thermal contact corrosion (occurring due to temperature rupture caused by uneven heating of the metal surface).

	The process of corrosion protection of equipment in sugar refineries is also very complex. Here such factors come into play as:
	1. Short period of time allotted for corrosion protection of equipment.
	2. Performance of work in very "cramped" conditions. Since all sugar production equipment is inside metal-filled, then to the high professional requirements of sandblasters and painters, have to add such a requirement as - "slimness", and in the literal sense of "flexibility" of the employee, because of the very cramped conditions of work (Fig. 1).
	However, all these difficulties of doing the work, prompted us to a number of technological solutions and inventions, which we have implemented at our enterprise, and now they are undergoing the procedure of certification in the RosPatent.


	Fig. 1. Internal space of the DS-12 diffuser
	Here is an example of the economic benefits of corrosion protection for one small but important in the production of sugar - SOT-60 pump. (Fig. 2)
	The normal service life (without corrosion protection) of the pump casing is 2 years, the service life of the pump impeller is a minimum of 2 pieces per year (in the process of one month's operation, there is virtually nothing left of the impeller not protected by corrosion protection). The cost of the pump casing is 40,000.00 rubles; the cost of one pump impeller is 8,000.00 rubles.
	Sandblasting to degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with the application of corrosion protection on the inside surface of the pump and the full surface of the impeller costs the customer 3,000.00 rubles.
	Sandblasting to degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with the application of corrosion protection on the inner surface of the pump and the full surface of the impeller, even with a minimum warranty period of 2 years, would save the factory from one pump 69 000.00 rubles per year:
	40 000.00 rubles (pump cost) + 32 000.00 rubles (cost of 4 impellers) =
	= 72 000.00 rubles - 3.000 rubles (the cost of corrosion protection for the entire pump) = 69.000 rubles (benefit in 2 years).
	That is, the corrosion protection of the internal surfaces of the pump and impeller, at a cost of 3,000.00 rubles, the service life of parts doubled and will save the customer 69,000.00 rubles per pump for 2 years of operation. And there are at least 8 pumps in a plant. What to say about such complex and important equipment in sugar production as diffusers.
	Imaginary savings in choosing between high-quality and cheap (low-quality) anti-corrosion protection of this equipment will inevitably cost the customer several million rubles to repair the equipment, as all of the above extreme conditions for half a season of operation, lead to through fistulas in the metal walls and deep ulcerous lesions on the entire inner surface of diffuser, pipes and coils. Thus, it is easy to calculate how much money the customer will save on the purchase of obsolete equipment due to the momentary "savings", abandoning the quality anti-corrosion protection of equipment. 

	Fig. 2. Pump SOT-60

	We wanted to draw attention to this industry manufacturers of paints, because in spite of our many years of experience in corrosion protection in this industry, the maximum warranty on the coating we can give 3-4 years. And it took us several years before we found, by trial and mistakes (and mistakes in our work are fraught with penalties in case of non-compliance with the warranty period), worthy manufacturers of paints and varnishes.
	Despite this fact, the question of protecting the metal from cavitation in the presence of low pH and high temperatures is still open.
	The main purpose of this report is a way to establish communication bridges between the producer of paints, the contractor corrosion protection and the customer of the corrosion protection works.
	I would also like to appeal to the Owners and Managers who produce paints and varnishes on behalf of performers of work on corrosion protection, again based on my own experience and the experience of colleagues: The problem of the issue is that, the competence of managers of some plants for the production of paints and varnishes is at a low level. When contacting managers of plants-manufacturers of paints and varnishes with a request to help in the selection of paint schemes for this or that equipment, describing the operating conditions, it is often impossible to get complete, comprehensive information. Contractors of corrosion protection works often have the opinion that the producer of paints and varnishes does not want to participate in the process of improving their products. 
	At the stages of selection of corrosion protection schemes we had to deal with such a phenomenon as unscrupulous manufacturers of paints. This fact cannot help but be depressing., it is not enough to get a certificate of quality from the producer of coatings, or rather getting a quality certificate from the manufacturer of the products can not be a guarantee that the material meets the stated characteristics in the GOST, or TU. And it is good, if the inconsistent quality is detected before the stage of application of the paintwork material on the prepared (in our case, cleaned to a degree Sa-2 ½ of GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014) surface, but not in the process, or the end of the technological process of sugar production, as in the second case the Manufacturer of corrosion protection works will bear financial losses to restore the corrosion-resistant protective coating within the warranty obligations.
	Also, we have encountered the fact that the information contained in the Technological Chart about the methods of applying paints and varnishes to surfaces may not correspond to reality. In connection with these circumstances, the question of creating some kind of Association of conscientious manufacturers of paints and varnishes becomes relevant. Like, for example, builders have SRO, NOSTROI, which is a guarantee that the organization has professionals in the field of construction. In my opinion the creation of the Association, in the first place, should be interested in the manufacturers of paints and varnishes, as, in addition to major customers such as "Transneft", "Lukoil", "Gazpromneft", etc., there are many customers from other businesses, which are in need of quality coatings, but alas, do not have the opportunity to have their own laboratories to test paint, to train their employees in nondestructive testing of coatings. And for these customers would be a huge help such an Association of conscientious manufacturers of paints and varnishes. And they would direct their finances to the purchase of known-quality paints and coatings, thereby saving themselves from litigation with unscrupulous manufacturers of paints and coatings, and from the costly costs of repeated repairs of equipment and repeated anti-corrosion protection.
	I would also like to mention the "desirable-mandatory" dialogue between the producer of paints and varnishes and us - the executors of works on corrosion protection. Our company StroyPromSnab LLC, like many others, seeks to gain new knowledge, to train their employees to work with technical innovations in terms of surface preparation and application of materials. It would be great if paint manufacturers introduced us to their materials, both new and those that have proven themselves on the market. At such meetings, presentations, together we could be very useful to each other! For example, often the managers of paints and coatings manufacturers do not know or do not want to know even in theory, what is the difference between air spraying methods and airless spraying of coatings, what is the difference in degree of cleaning Sa-2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 etc.
	Managers of the manufacturer will be able to visually understand how their materials work in practice. For the workers, it will give them the opportunity to understand the peculiarities of working with a particular material.
	After all, not all manufacturers of paints include a professional painter who tests materials using different methods of application with the latest paint sprayers, nozzles and application conditions. Neither do corrosion protection contractors have a paint technologist on staff, because the knowledge of a paint inspector is sometimes insufficient.
	Continuing the topic of unfairness, I would like to note that there are a lot of unfair organizations among contractors on corrosion protection who use the fact that the Customer often has a very superficial knowledge in the field of corrosion protection (despite the acute problem of corrosion in the sugar industry) and pass off poor-quality work as high-quality. For example, cleaning of the inner surface of diffuser DS-12 of 1500 m2, affected by solid corrosion degree D, with numerous ulcers up to 4 millimeters deep, such performers allegedly clean the metal surface to a degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014, 2 tons of abrasive!!! And this at a nominal consumption of abrasive for this degree of corrosion damage 25-30 kg/m2!
	Thus, any cleaning of the metal surface to a degree Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 is out of the question, such a cleaning is not even "pulling" on the light sweeping, and is a deception of the customer.
	In 2020, when sandblasting the inner surface of the pulp-press water collector (previously painted by unscrupulous contractors), our organization encountered a record consumption of abrasive, which amounted to 100 kg/m2 ! The depth of corrosion of the metal was up to 5 millimeters, in some places there were through fissures (Fig. 3). This fact was a consequence of the fact that the previous unscrupulous contractors had not properly prepared the surface before applying the paint, namely, the paint was applied to a poorly prepared surface (the surface was not cleaned of mill scale and corrosion).

	Fig. 3. Consequences of coating over mill scale

	On many occasions, we observe a situation where there is no preparation of the previously painted surface at all, and we see a kind of "multilayer pie of paint coatings," which were applied over previous layers of paintwork and without removing the corrosion (Fig. 4).

	Fig. 4. Multilayer paintwork, applied annually without removing previous layers

	This coating to the average person from a distance seems integral, but in fact resembles poorly glued wallpaper, which can be effortlessly, in large fragments, separate from the metal. Such a coating has almost no adhesion to the metal and corrosion processes proceed unhindered under it (Fig. 5).

	Fig. 5. Peeling coating applied to an unprepared surface

	In the sugar industry, the fight against such contractors is simple, with the help of "word of mouth" as all plants are in contact with each other at the level of managers. In exactly the same way information about quality paintwork materials and anticorrosive protection contractors is disseminated.
	Another problem in this direction is the management of customers (sugar refineries). On the one hand, they help to save money for the Beneficiaries by choosing the cheapest corrosion protection service, but they also bring even more losses to the Beneficiaries by having to spend not on corrosion protection, but on expensive repairs to replace the metal structures of the equipment, which have deteriorated due to poor quality of corrosion protection of the equipment. This, alas, is the reason why specialists who organize purchases are often not very familiar with sugar production technology and, moreover, have little idea of the specifics of anti-corrosion protection works. And the only criterion for choosing corrosion protection services of such managers is a low price, but as we know "cheap" is often synonymous to the word "low-quality". At those enterprises where there is direct contact between the management of the plant and the beneficiaries, there is an opportunity to convey a reasonable idea of what quality corrosion protection is - when expensive technological equipment is preserved and expensive metal elements do not have to be replaced or replaced every year.
	Our company is now working on bringing to a single standard for corrosion protection works in sugar production, so that such a standard would become a handbook for the management of sugar refineries. We were motivated to create such a handbook for sugar factory managers by the lack of knowledge of the Customer of corrosion protection works where we have to explain and prove the facts which are well known and are axiomatic in the oil and gas sector. For example, such as: new metal must be cleaned of mill scale before painting - this operation is perceived by the Customer at sugar refineries as imposing an additional operation. This also applies to the number/thickness of layers of paint, and the timing of polymerization of the coating before the commissioning of the equipment. In connection with this fact, and at the numerous requests of sugar refinery managers, our company has decided to create such a Guidebook on corrosion protection for sugar refineries.
	In conclusion of the report, we would like to draw attention of the Customers to the obligatory qualitative work on corrosion protection, it has obvious economic benefit for the Customer.
	Producers of paints and varnishes and performers of corrosion protection works should educate the Customers of corrosion protection works about the fact that by purchasing more expensive, but high-quality corrosion protection works performed by quality paintwork materials the Customer saves money on premature repairs of equipment that would have become worthless under the influence of corrosion.
	Customers of works on corrosion protection, to be more careful in selecting contractors of corrosion protection, and be guided not only by the cheap cost of the work.
	Draw the attention of manufacturers of paints and varnishes to the symbiosis and cooperation with performers of works on corrosion protection, to combine practical skills and theoretical knowledge. Producers of paints and coatings should consider the possibility of establishing the Association of bona fide manufacturers of paints and varnishes.

Introduction

The environmental safety of the food industry requires preventing the contamination of food products with metallic impurities. Since the equipment of sugar factories is made mainly of carbon steel, iron contamination of products can occur through corrosion.
If the iron content in human consumption of food or water is above the threshold limit value (TLV) (5-15 mg/kg), it accumulates in the body, causing diseases siderosis and hemosiderosis, which affects the liver and blood. In order to produce products without metallic impurities it is necessary to ensure high corrosion resistance of steel surfaces that come into contact with food media in the technological cycle [1]
As required by GOST R 54762¬ 2011/ISO/TS 22002¬1:2009 all "surfaces in contact with foodstuffs must be impervious and free of rust or corrosion" [2].

Factors affecting the corrosion of equipment in sugar beet processing plants

In sugar refineries, corrosion protection of diffusers, sulphite extractant collectors, pulp press water lines and collectors, accumulation collectors, supports of the pulp gallery and rake conveyors consists in the application of anti-corrosion coatings.
The high requirements for corrosion protection coatings are due to the following aggressive environment in which equipment parts are operated in the production of beet sugar:

- temperature fluctuations in different stages from 10 to 120 °C;
- presence of dissociated organic acids;
- action of inorganic substances and their salts;
- a complex biochemical process;
- oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases dissolved in the medium;
- movement of the medium under pressure and agitation;
- acidic environment (pH 4-6), in which iron corrodes much more intensively than in an alkaline environment [3, p. 6, 13].

Prolonged contact of metal with aggressive environment because of the continuous production cycle, which lasts from 4 to 7 months, depending on the yield of sugar beets in the current year, intensifies the course of all corrosive processes.
Most of the known types of corrosion occur in sugar production. Electrochemical corrosion in electrolytes (acids, salts and alkalis) is observed when parts are partially or completely immersed in the food medium, its rate increases with increasing temperature. The simultaneous action of the corrosive medium and frictional forces causes fretting corrosion when sugar beet chips mixed with water are moved by screws or by pressure distillation from one process unit to another. The impact of the liquid corrosive component of the technological process, which moves under pressure, causes corrosive cavitation. Because of the uneven heating of the metal surface, a thermal contact corrosion takes place, and if metals with different electrochemical potentials come into contact with each other, a contact corrosion takes place. Crevice corrosion occurs in gaps and crevices between parts. Since water is taken from water bodies for washing the beets, the abrasive effect of sand suspensions is added to cavitation [4].
At high temperatures the most important type of chemical corrosion occurs - gas corrosion, when metal interacts with active gas media: water vapor, oxygen, hydrogen sulfide and other gases. Temperature fluctuations during heating (especially during alternate heating and cooling) cause destruction of oxide films and increase the rate of gas corrosion [5, p. 28].

Ways to protect equipment from corrosion

The main type of protection of technological equipment in the sugar industry - protective coatings intended to isolate the metal from direct contact with corrosive and aggressive environment, more resistant in this environment than the protected metal. Modern coatings provide protection that meets the requirements of operating conditions and durability.
Paint and varnish coatings are cheaper than metal ones, easier to apply, more versatile; they do not change the properties of the coated metal. They are based on film-forming synthetic resins to which various combinations of fillers, plasticizers, solvents, catalysts and pigments are added. Insoluble pigments - titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, aluminum powder, chromium oxide and others, ground into a powder with particles from 0.5 to 5 microns, give coatings strength, hardness, heat resistance, color [6, p. 85-87].
After the paint materials applied in a thin layer dries, a protective film is formed on the metal surface, held in place by adhesion forces.
In order to improve the adhesion and respectively the corrosive properties of surfaces, their preparation for painting is carried out. Reliability and durability of protective coatings of metal structures largely depend on the method and quality of preparation [3, p. 28]. GOST 9.4022004 "Unified system of protection against corrosion and aging" prescribes the removal from the surface of all substances that contribute to corrosion and prevent coloring. The surface must be free of scale, rust, old paint residues, welding slag, castings burnout and other contaminants [7].
New hot-rolled metal is always covered with scale, rust, dust and other contaminants appear on it during storage and transportation. Any scale and rust reduce the adhesion of the paint coating and become a focus of destruction of the coating and metal. Therefore, descaling and rust cleaning is a mandatory operation before painting immediately after delivery of new equipment parts made of steel [8, p. 85]. To ensure that the coating guaranteed adhesion and absolute protection of steel against corrosion, before its it is necessary to ensure the appropriate surface profile and degree of its cleaning.
Compressed air abrasive blasting is used to clean metal of old coatings, rust and scale and to roughen it up. Cooperslag and nickelslag are the abrasives most suitable for cleaning sugar refinery equipment, including deep corrosion removal. By selecting the size of cuper slag granules, air pressure, distance and angle of the nozzle, cuts are made at a depth from 20 to 140 microns, depending on the paint material used. Sharp, angular pellets have the hardness of 6.5 on the Mohs scale [9, p. 17-19]. This makes it possible to achieve the purification degree
Sa 2½ GOST R ISO 8501.1.2014, when examination with the naked eye reveals no rust, scale, remains of old paint and other non-metallic inclusions [10]. Nickel slag has similar properties but higher hardness [9, p. 33]. Before abrasive cleaning the metal surfaces are degreased with a solvent, after it the surface is dusted with air under pressure. Corrosion protection coating usually consists of two layers of primer and a finishing layer of enamel. Specialists of LLC "StroyPromSnab" (Krasnodar) have developed and implemented a number of technological solutions and inventions, which are now being registered in Rospatent. The company is working on the creation of a unified standard for corrosion protection of sugar factory equipment [4]. Only ⅔ of the metal destroyed by corrosion can be put back into circulation by remelting. The rest of the metal, amounting to 10-15% of the volume of its annual production, is lost irretrievably. In addition to direct losses in the form of costs for repair or replacement of expensive equipment producers bear indirect financial losses due to emergency shutdowns of corrosion-damaged equipment and reduction of the grade of products contaminated by its products [6, p. 3, 5].

Conclusion

The beet sugar industry is one in which corrosion is probably the most damaging to equipment. Corrosion protection of the metal surfaces of the processing equipment is definitely needed here. Corrosion protection can be ensured by proper surface preparation and the application of paint and varnish materials that are suitable for the operating conditions.

Abstract. The article deals with the problem of corrosion in the production of beet sugar in terms of improving the service life and environmental safety of technological equipment. The possibility of contamination of the food environment by corrosion products is noted. In addition, corrosion destruction of metal brings tangible losses to both individual enterprises and the industry as a whole. The main factors of aggressiveness of the environment in which equipment parts are operated, types of corrosion typical for sugar production are listed. Protective paint and varnish coatings, which isolate the metal surface from the corrosive and aggressive environment, are considered as the main protection. Particular attention is paid to the quality of surface preparation for painting, including for new equipment. The work of Krasnodar specialists on a unified standard of anticorrosive protective coatings in the sugar industry is noted.

Maintaining

To date, the rate of sugar production in the Russian Federation is increasing. The active policy of some companies is to expand production, increase the volume of sales of products, and increase net profit. However, to achieve these results in the future is only possible with the proper organization of management activities, including in terms of enterprise services.
It is up to the company's management to take timely measures to prevent the destruction of equipment.
In an era of acute cash shortages due to the crisis of many companies, an important factor is the preservation of current fixed assets of the company by reducing the amount of depreciation of production. As practice shows, the service life of equipment is shortened under the influence of various circumstances: improper operation, lack of proper and timely maintenance, human influence, load and time of use, and its quality. It is worth noting that the most rapid wear and tear of technological equipment production occurs due to corrosion, which can damage as insignificant (easily replaceable) parts of the equipment, and important, expensive parts and mechanisms. In some cases, the rapid deterioration of equipment is due to the specific industries in the absence of anti-corrosion treatment of metals. Often the management of enterprises tends to unreasonably save money by not providing equipment corrosion protection at the proper level, which in the long term leads to a huge increase in the cost of its replacement as a whole. Of course, corrosion protection does not guarantee eternal safety of the equipment, but it can significantly extend its life. It should be noted that with the rising prices of imported goods and the lack of domestic counterparts, the expenditure items in the budget of the enterprise when replacing technological equipment increases several times.

Justification of the expediency of corrosion protection of equipment

We have analyzed multiple aspects of technological equipment protection, as well as calculation of economic benefits of corrosion protection application at sugar production enterprises. In order to select the basic methodology, we conducted an analysis of literary sources, applied methods of observation, comparison and abstraction. The method of complex mathematical analysis was used to calculate the economic benefit. The above methodology is used in the overall system as a set of interrelated elements. Today, companies pursue an active policy to increase profits and long-term planned cost reductions, while often neglecting the technological protection of equipment. Managers of various enterprises note that many protective measures have a high cost, which cannot be justified during the year of economic activity. For example, many companies refuse to properly maintain equipment, which leads to irreversible consequences: at a minimum, the production components become unusable, and at a maximum, this process is accompanied by human losses [1]. In the context of the topic, it is important to consider the need to protect process equipment from corrosion in the production of sugar refinery.
As is known, sugar production is one of the most aggressive in terms of corrosion of equipment, because the process of sugar production takes place in several stages, each of which is accompanied by the formation of any aggressive environment, which has a devastating effect on the expensive products.

The main factors of wear and tear of equipment in sugar production

Based on the cycle of beet processing in a sugar refinery, there are several major factors in the rapid deterioration of equipment:
– high temperature exposure;
– release of various chemicals that destroy the protective layers of the metal;
- high rates of continuous production - four to seven months.

The impact on the equipment during sugar beet processing leads to corrosion of different types: chemical, gas, contact, thermal contact, abrasion, cavitation, erosion, etc. Each of them requires a special treatment approach.
At the same time the increased wear and tear of the equipment due to the impact of aggressive substances simply dictates to the company management the need for timely, albeit expensive, protection of production lines, in case of failure of which the company risks not only to lose most of the equipment, but also to stop production completely, which will also entail huge costs. Corrosion and abrasion drastically reduces the life of the equipment, metals under its influence are destroyed rapidly, and if the damage is not detected in time, the technical means must be completely replaced. This situation leads to a high increase in direct costs. Along with this there are indirect losses associated with the impact of metals on the product of processing (in our case sugar solutions), which sometimes reach a sum higher than the cost of repair of equipment.

Methods and techniques of anti-corrosion protection

At the present stage, corrosive effects on process equipment, along with structural metals, are becoming a very acute engineering problem. Due to the above factors, there is an urgent need to increase the wear resistance and durability of the equipment, which is facilitated by active corrosion protection. The enterprise should either conduct its own research in this area or turn to private verified organizations that provide this service. 
There are several basic and most effective ways to solve this problem.
1. Application of inhibitors. This method makes it possible not to rebuild the overall scheme of the technological production system and not to incur significant costs for the enterprise. It allows the use of fairly inexpensive (relatively special) structural metals. At the same time, its use when introduced into food products is not possible (clearly prohibited by the sanitary and state requirements on quality standards for the manufacture of products). However, it is possible to preserve the protective layer of the metal with the help of inhibitors for a long time.

Inhibitors are used in a wide range of industries:
– acid washings of technological equipment (scale removal, mineral deposits);
– in the protection of the water supply (both industrial and domestic);
– in the sugar industry (when cleaning various containers intended for storage and transportation of the contents); – in cooling systems of technological equipment (protection against atmospheric corrosion). 
In general, the very process of inhibitor application reflects a high degree of corrosion protection. According to the results of the study of corrosion protection activity of inhibitors and their concentrates it was recommended to use them for protection of mechanisms in food production [2]. The authors emphasize not only sufficiently high efficiency of the inhibitor-concentrate, but also its applicability to the food industry enterprises, including sugar production.
2. Use of passivators – highly effective method for neutral aquatic environment. Passivators are inorganic substances with a certain set of redox properties, which change the corrosion potential by passivation of metal. As noted earlier, sugar production is characterized by an extremely high degree of aggressiveness of the environment, which emphasizes the impossibility or limited use of passivators [3].
3. Zinc surface protection is widely used by many companies. However, there are some limitations - the wear resistance of zinc decreases when exposed to aggressive environments (especially in water, acidic and alkaline environments). High temperatures are also detrimental to the protective layer of zinc - at temperatures up to 70 there is the highest risk of occurrence of corrosion of the metal. [4].
4. Application of paint and varnish materials in anticorrosive treatment. This method is one of the most popular and effective (and relatively low-cost). Application of paints and varnishes depends on the type, composition, manufacturer and specific purpose [5]. For example, the use of varnish KHS-76 is possible in the food industry. This coating protects against acids, alkalis, aggressive gases. The result and the quality of the application of coatings for corrosion protection often depends on the specific service provider. It should be noted that the method of applying coating materials on a previously prepared surface is particularly effective and at the same time less costly for the company.
The direct algorithm of conducting of anti-rust works is as follows:
– Specialist visit to the enterprise in order to assess the pavement to be restored and determine the possibility and need for preparatory and follow-up work. Often this stage is implemented in the context of calling a specialist at the end of the warranty period of previous work for an inspection for further execution of the contract;
– surface preparation by treatment (mechanical, chemical or thermal);
– priming and puttying the surface;
– applying paint coatings (taking into account the specific conditions, environment and other factors).

Comparative analysis of production costs

Economic calculations are based on two Russian sugar refineries:
- CJSC "Sugar Refinery Tikhoretskiy". The enterprise is a part of JSC "Agrocomplex" named after N.I. Tkachev, which corresponds to the top-5 ranking of the largest Russian producers of sugar sand;
– OJSC Valuikisakhar. It is a part of the Rusagro Holding, one of the leading beet sugar producers in the Russian Federation. The plant is coordinated by Rusago-Center LLC, whose activities are aimed at increasing the total volume of sugar production, expanding production lines, developing the sales market [6].
In order to calculate the economic benefits, an analysis of both individual production complexes in terms of a comparison of the cost of their protection (taking into account the protection period, the need for re-treatment, complexity and other factors), and possible depreciation losses associated with complete or partial replacement of equipment was made. Note that the calculation of economic benefits excludes the factor of loss arising from production downtime, because the cycle of sugar production is from four to seven months (it is assumed that active anti-corrosion operations will be carried out in the non-production period).

Cost Stages

1. Calling an inspector does not always require additional funds - the maximum cost can vary in the range of 20 thousand rubles (for transportation costs and payment for housing).
2. The work of abrasive surface cleaning is the most materially and labor cost part of corrosion protection, because it includes the cost of materials, directly on the process and the cleaning of the room from the spent abrasive material. During the work material consumption varies from 10 to 30 kg /m2. For example, the quality cleaning of the diffuser DS-12 with an area of 1,500 m2 will require from 15 to 40 tons of couperslag or nickelslag. In this case, the surface cleaning rate is from 5 to 15 m2/h. It should be noted that the use of silica sand threatens the risk of lung silicosis, so it is not used in the course of work. Quality degree of coating cleaning (Sa-2 or Sa-2.5) without which the main work - the application of paint materials can not be made, requires a high consumption of abrasive material.
3. Priming the surface (with one layer) on average costs 400 r/m2.
4. The cost of applying paint directly depends on the degree of cleaning, the manufacturer and the price of the paint, as well as the warranty formed.
The average consumption for applying one layer of paint is 300 g/m2. Three to four layers will require 750 to 1000 g/m2 of material. Here is a typical example: if you clean the surface to a degree Sa-2, followed by the application of the minimum thickness of paint coatings in the dry condition of 180 microns and a guarantee on the coating in two production seasons will cost 1500 r/m2 treated surface. With a degree of cleaning Sa-2,5 (about 95% of clean surface), dry paint thickness of 250 microns and with a guarantee of three production seasons (the duration of one season, usually from five to six months) price of 2000 rubles/m2 (prices are excluding VAT). As a specific example of equipment treated against corrosion is the diffuser DS-12. The approximate amount of work is about 1500 m2 [7].
Here are economic calculations of the cost of anti-corrosion treatment (excluding VAT):
1) with the degree of cleaning Sa-2, dry surface thickness of 180 microns and warranty for two production seasons the costs are:
1,500 × 1,350 = 2,250,000 rubles (2.25 million rubles). This should also include additional reserve costs about 200 thousand rubles. Total 2,45 mil. r.;
2) with the degree of cleaning of Sa-2.5, a dry surface thickness of 250 microns and a warranty for three production seasons, the costs are:
2000 × 1500 = 3 mil r. Similarly to the previous method, taking into account possible additional costs, the amount of costs will be 3,2 mil. r.
If we consider each of the degrees of protection in the context of the cost by season, we get the picture shown in Fig. 1.
 
Fig. 1. The cost of one year of corrosion protection of equipment: 1) the cost of one production season will cost the company about 1.225 million rubles; 2) the cost of one production season will be about 1.066 million rubles.
It should be taken into account that if you choose the second option, the quality of performance of the service provided increases due to a higher degree of abrasive surface cleaning, meanwhile the cost of corrosion protection is reduced by 160 thousand rubles per year. Over 12 years of using Sa-2.5 protection, the consumer will be able to save about 1,900 thousand rubles. Thus, according to the results of the overall economic analysis, the second option of cleaning and surface treatment of equipment becomes the most effective.
The cost of just one DS-12 unit at retail price ranges from 2.5 to 3 million euros (210-255 million rubles), depending on the initial capacity, manufacturer and exchange rate. To date, the diffusion for DS-12 is made of carbon steel only in Poland. The cost of a used diffuser DS-12 is two to four times lower.
Sometimes a company buys a diffuser, expecting to use it from 20 to 30 years, which is higher than the warranty period. This life can only be extended by timely maintenance, including corrosion protection. The operating time shows the direct benefit of its use. It should be taken into account that the cost of the equipment is specified without taking into account delivery, supplier, installation, maintenance of technical and accounting documentation (the basis of the calculation is 20 years of service and the cost of the unit equal to 50 million rubles), the possible need to suspend production and other multiple cost factors. For example, to maintain a minimum 30-year service life of the diffuser with regular work on corrosion protection will cost on average about 31-32 million rubles (which is comparable to the cost of one-eighth of a new diffuser DS-12). If do not provide appropriate work, the impact of corrosive environment will quickly lead to the loss of equipment, which will come earlier than 15 years of service - this will lead to higher costs for the purchase of new equipment DS-12, taking into account all of the above nuances.
Thus, the enterprise has two ways:
1) carry out anti-corrosion protection of equipment, the cost of which will be about 1 million rubles per year;
2) upgrade equipment every 12-20 years with a minimum maintenance cost of 16 million rubles per year.
The economic benefit of maintaining production equipment for a long time becomes obvious, which in the long term will reduce the total cost of the enterprise by several times. Work on corrosion protection should be carried out by proven individuals who will be able to provide the company with appropriate guarantees.
The other side of calculating the economic feasibility of measures for corrosion protection is an assessment of the condition of the equipment in cases where it is protected and in cases where there is no protection. You can come to a certain conclusion by applying the method of assessing the economic depreciation of equipment [8]. It is important to take into account the economic depreciation calculated by the formula
Dm=((Cb-Cc))/Cc 100%,

where
Dm – depreciation of equipment; 
Cb – initial cost; 
Cc – recovery cost.

It is necessary to reflect economic depreciation of equipment during each five years of operation (on the basis of 50 million - cost of used equipment):
	without any protective measures with a period of operation:
– 5 years: Dm = (50 – 16,5) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 67 %;
– 10 years: Dm = (50 – 33) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 34 %;
– 15 years: Dm= (50 – 49,5) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 1 %;
2) at the cost of corrosion protection with a period of operation:
– 5 years: Dm = (50 – 5,33) / 50 ∙100 % = 89,34 %;
– 10 years: Dm = (50 – 10,66) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 78,68 %;
– 15 years: Dm = (50 – 16) / 50 ∙ 100 % = 68 %.
The graph of the equipment status is shown in Fig. 2.
 
Fig. 2. Estimation of material depreciation of equipment

According to the data obtained, we can clearly trace a high degree of wear of the equipment, especially increasing after 10 years of operation. Corrosion protection measures smooth out the wear schedule, making it more linear towards the original condition. However, the present model does not take into account the devastating effects of corrosive environments on sugar production equipment, which emphasizes the higher degree of its real wear and tear.

Conclusions

Thus, the research results reflect the high relevance of the stated topic. Undoubtedly, the protection of technological equipment of sugar production is necessary, as it allows the company to significantly reduce the upcoming costs. The results of the economic analysis showed that corrosion protection measures significantly extend the life of the technical equipment of the enterprise. Planning to carry out anti-corrosion protection, it is important to find a company that will qualitatively perform the service and provide all appropriate guarantees to the enterprise. The use of corrosion protection of existing technological equipment is more appropriate than the purchase of new equipment.
