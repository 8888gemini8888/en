        <p><em>Yuri Batsko inspector for visual and measuring quality control of painting, chief executive StroyPromSnab LLC, Krasnodar</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Sugar is a valuable food product as well as a raw material that is actively used in the food industry as a sweetener or gelling agent in food production (confectionery, sweets, soft drinks, dairy products, etc.). [1, 2].</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The main raw materials for sugar production in the world market are sugar cane and sugar beet. In the Russian food industry the predominant share is sugar produced from sugar beet.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The technology of sugar beet processing, the main principles of which are still used by Russian sugar makers today, was developed in 1802 by engineer Osip Esipov and applied at the factory in the village of Alyabyevo, Tula province.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In 2022 the sugar beet industry in Russia celebrates its 220th anniversary. However, despite the development of the domestic sugar industry, as well as the great importance of sugar and sugar products for the Russian economy, recently there has been a significant decline in the competitiveness of sugar produced by Russian enterprises from sugar beets compared to sugar from imported raw sugar [3]. This fact necessitates the search for methods of increasing the efficiency of production by reducing production losses and introduction of resource-saving technologies.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>The aim of the work</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Assessment of the efficiency of domestic sugar refineries shows that one of the key factors that reduce their profitability are high losses associated with the destruction of equipment parts due to metal corrosion [4]. High corrosion aggressiveness of equipment working environment is caused by:</p>
        
        <p>- high temperature, reaching at certain stages&nbsp; 125 oC;</p>
        
        <p>- abrasion and erosion of metal surfaces;</p>
        
        <p>- presence of aggressive additives (proteins, amino acids, calcium oxide, organic acids, ammonia, sulfuric acid, etc.);</p>
        
        <p>- Continuous production cycle of 4 to 7 months.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In addition to purely economic losses, corrosion can also lead to cracking and destruction of pipelines and tanks, which would have catastrophic consequences and pose a direct threat to the health and lives of the company&#39;s personnel.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Thus, taking into account the importance of reducing production losses for increasing the profitability of the domestic sugar industry and its safety, the processes of corrosion of steel surfaces of sugar refineries equipment were researched within the framework of this work. A method of applying protective coatings designed to reduce the influence of aggressive environment on the surface condition of equipment parts was tested. Evaluation of financial costs associated with corrosion, as well as the economic effect from the use of protective coatings was made.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Research Methods</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The research was carried out at the sugar refinery &quot;Crystal&quot; JSC firm &quot;Agrocomplex&quot; named after N.I. Tkachev (Russia, Krasnodar Territory, Vyselki village) during the technical maintenance of equipment.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>At the first stage the general inspection of metal surfaces of the parts, in direct contact with aggressive medium and different types of corrosion damages of the equipment were identified.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>In order to determine the corrosion rate, electrochemical tests were carried out according to the technique described earlier (see, for example, [5]). For this purpose, samples of low-carbon steel with an area of 50 cm2 were degreased, cleaned, polished, weighed, then placed at an angle of 45o in glass flasks with various aggressive media similar to those used production. Tests were conducted for 24 hours at a maintained temperature range of 55-60 oC. The samples were then air dried until completely dry. Next, on one flat side of each sample, the corrosion products formed during the experiment were removed to the original steel luster, and then the samples were then weighed.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Results and discussion</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Qualitative analysis of the state of units and mechanisms of the equipment production line of a sugar refinery after a season of operation revealed significant traces of corrosion. Visual examination of metal surfaces revealed traces of corrosion of various types.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>These included:</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>- chemical corrosion;</p>
        
        <p>- corrosion in electrolytes (salts, acids, alkalis) with complete or partial immersion in a moving or stationary medium;</p>
        
        <p>- fretting corrosion, or corrosive erosion (with simultaneous effects of corrosive media and frictional forces)</p>
        
        <p>- cavitation corrosion (impact of a corrosive medium); cavitation corrosion medium);</p>
        
        <p>- abrasive action of sand suspensions;</p>
        
        <p>- thermal contact corrosion (occurs due to thermal destruction caused by uneven heating of the metal surface).</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Sugar production from sugar beets is a multi-stage process, which includes the following steps: cleaning the beets from impurities, cutting the beets into shavings, extracting sugar from the shavings, desugaring raw material and juice purification, juice thickening, sugar crystallization, separation of crystallized sugar from the solution, and sugar drying [6].</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>To determine the most aggressive stage of corrosion, samples of the liquid medium interacting with the metal surface of steel samples were selected at various stages of production and tested under laboratory conditions. The results of the tests are presented in the diagram (Fig. 1). Here it is clearly seen that the diffusion sap turned out to be the most aggressive of all the liquids tested.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The second most aggressive solution was the standard syrup. Unrefined and clarified (before evaporation) juices were the least aggressive. The rate of corrosion depended significantly on the value of acidity (pH) measured in the studied liquid media. Thus, the results of the measurements in Fig. 1 can be explained by the tendency of steels and alloys to corrosion in acid medium.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>It should also be noted that the rate of corrosion in the tested solutions and temperatures is significantly higher than is commonly believed for certain pH values. It follows that acids in the working solutions used in various stages of beet sugar production in conjunction with high temperatures are more destructive to steel equipment than low pH values.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>As the the production process, aggressive elements such as proteins, amino acids, calcium oxide (burnt lime) are added or produced, pectins, CO2 (carbonation gas), organic acids, ammonia, sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, barometric water, sulfuric acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, calcium hydroxide, saponins, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), sulfur oxide sulfur oxide (SO2), etc.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>It is worth noting that samples that were tested in diffusion juice and standard syrup solutions showed incipient pockets of pitting corrosion. This clearly indicates that if the steel equipment is used for a longer time in contact with these solutions, the consequences of corrosion will be even more devastating than what is shown in the diagram in Fig. 1.</p>

        <p><strong>Suggestions for production</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>A promising method to reduce the effects of aggressive environment on metal surfaces of sugar refineriy equipment, as well as to slow down corrosion processes is the use of protective coatings. As a rule, works on protection of equipment are very labor-intensive. This is due to the following factors: short time allocated for anticorrosion treatment and a large number of hard-to-reach places which limits the possibility of coating. However the technological solutions realized by the company StroyPromSnab Ltd. the efficiency of corrosion protection. Thus, these solutions open up prospects for reducing production losses and increasing the competitiveness of domestic sugar producers.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Let us evaluate the economic effect from the application of anticorrosion coatings at sugar factories on the example of SOT-60 pump (Fig. 2). This pump is an important part of the production lines of domestic enterprises. The total number of pumps of this type at one plant can reach eight pieces. The service life of the pump casing without anticorrosion coating does not exceed two years. At the same time, the impeller should be replaced twice a year, and sometimes more often. At the time this article was written, the market price of SOT-60 pump body was about 140 thousand rubles, and the price of one pump impeller was 8 thousand rubles. Accordingly, maintenance of one SOT-60 pump for two years costs the plant about 172 thousand rubles. At the same time the cost of sand-blasting cleaning of all the internal surface of one pump (including the casing and the impeller) up to the grade Sa-21/2 GOST R ISO 8501-1-2014 with the application of multilayer corrosion-resistant protective coating of 200 microns thick amounts to 6 thousand rubles.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Studies show that this procedure can increase the service life of the pump by two times (possibly even more) [4]. Thus, economic effect from application of anticorrosion coating for one pump reaches 166 thousand rubles for two years.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>The research showed that corrosion of the internal metal surfaces of sugar refineries equipment is the cause of large production losses, reducing the competitiveness of the final product. The rate of corrosion varies at different stages of the sugar production process due to the different acidity of the aggressive media affecting the metal surface. It was also shown that the use of protective anti-corrosion coatings significantly reduces the corrosion rate.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        
        <p>Evaluation of the value of production losses indicates a significant positive economic effect from the use of protective coatings on equipment parts. Thus, the results of this research confirm high efficiency of the method of reducing losses from corrosion by applying anti-corrosion coatings on the equipment being in an aggressive environment in order to increase of economic efficiency of sugar refineries.</p>
